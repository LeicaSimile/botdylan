but in the stage of progress into which the more civilised portions of the species have now entered, it presents itself under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental treatment end_token the struggle between liberty and authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of greece, rome, and england end_token but in old times this contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government end_token by liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of the political rulers end_token the rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled end_token they consisted of a governing one, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise end_token their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects, no less than against external enemies end_token to prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down end_token but as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws end_token the aim, therefore, of patriots, was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty end_token it was attempted in two ways end_token first, by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable end_token a second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power end_token to the first of these modes of limitation, the ruling power, in most european countries, was compelled, more or less, to submit end_token it was not so with the second; and to attain this, or when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely, became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty end_token and so long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point end_token a time, however, came, in the progress of human affairs, when men ceased to think it a necessity of nature that their governors should be an independent power, opposed in interest to themselves end_token it appeared to them much better that the various magistrates of the state should be their tenants or delegates, revocable at their pleasure end_token in that way alone, it seemed, could they have complete security that the powers of government would never be abused to their disadvantage end_token by degrees, this new demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent object of the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed; and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limit the power of rulers end_token as the struggle proceeded for making the ruling power emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, some persons began to think that too much importance had been attached to the limitation of the power itself end_token that (it might seem) was a resource against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the people end_token what was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified with the people; that their interest and will should be the interest and will of the nation end_token the nation did not need to be protected against its own will end_token there was no fear of its tyrannising over itself end_token let the rulers be effectually responsible to it, promptly removable by it, and it could afford to trust them with power of which it could itself dictate the use to be made end_token their power was but the nation's own power, concentrated, and in a form convenient for exercise end_token this mode of thought, or rather perhaps of feeling, was common among the last generation of european liberalism, in the continental section of which it still apparently predominates end_token those who admit any limit to what a government may do, except in the case of such governments as they think ought not to exist, stand out as brilliant exceptions among the political thinkers of the continent end_token a similar tone of sentiment might by this time have been prevalent in our own country, if the circumstances which for a time encouraged it, had continued unaltered end_token but, in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons, success discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have concealed from observation end_token the notion, that the people have no need to limit their power over themselves, might seem axiomatic, when popular government was a thing only dreamed about, or read of as having existed at some distant period of the past end_token neither was that notion necessarily disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the french revolution, the worst of which were the work of a usurping few, and which, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popular institutions, but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak against monarchical and aristocratic despotism end_token in time, however, a democratic republic came to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface, and made itself felt as one of the most powerful members of the community of nations; and elective and responsible government became subject to the observations and criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact end_token it was now perceived that such phrases as \"self-government,\" and \"the power of the people over themselves,\" do not express the true state of the case end_token the \"people\" who exercise the power are not always the same people with those over whom it is exercised; and the \"self-government\" spoken of is not the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest end_token the will of the people, moreover, practically means, the will of the most numerous or the most active part of the people; the majority, or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: the people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other abuse of power end_token the limitation, therefore, of the power of government over individuals, loses none of its importance when the holders of power are regularly accountable to the community, that is, to the strongest party therein end_token this view of things, recommending itself equally to the intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those important classes in european society to whose real or supposed interests democracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in establishing itself; and in political speculations \"the tyranny of the majority\" is now generally included among the evils against which society requires to be on its guard end_token like other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority was at first, and is still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts of the public authorities end_token but reflecting persons perceived that when society is itself the tyrant society collectively, over the separate individuals who compose it its means of tyrannising are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries end_token society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself end_token protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to fetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the formation, of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own end_token there is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence: and to find that limit, and maintain it against encroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs, as protection against political despotism end_token but though this proposition is not likely to be contested in general terms, the practical question, where to place the limit how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done end_token all that makes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people end_token some rules of conduct, therefore, must be imposed, by law in the first place, and by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law end_token what these rules should be, is the principal question in human affairs; but if we except a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those which least progress has been made in resolving end_token no two ages, and scarcely any two countries, have decided it alike; and the decision of one age or country is a wonder to another end_token yet the people of any given age and country no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject on which mankind had always been agreed end_token the rules which obtain among themselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying end_token this all but universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of custom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a second nature, but is continually mistaken for the first end_token the effect of custom, in preventing any misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which mankind impose on one another, is all the more complete because the subject is one on which it is not generally considered necessary that reasons should be given, either by one person to others, or by each to himself end_token people are accustomed to believe, and have been encouraged in the belief by some who aspire to the character of philosophers, that their feelings, on subjects of this nature, are better than reasons, and render reasons unnecessary end_token the practical principle which guides them to their opinions on the regulation of human conduct, is the feeling in each person's mind that everybody should be required to act as he, and those with whom he sympathises, would like them to act end_token no one, indeed, acknowledges to himself that his standard of judgment is his own liking; but an opinion on a point of conduct, not supported by reasons, can only count as one person's preference; and if the reasons, when given, are a mere appeal to a similar preference felt by other people, it is still only many people's liking instead of one end_token to an ordinary man, however, his own preference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactory reason, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of morality, taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in his religious creed; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that end_token men's opinions, accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, are affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the conduct of others, and which are as numerous as those which determine their wishes on any other subject end_token sometimes their reason at other times their prejudices or superstitions: often their social affections, not seldom their anti-social ones, their envy or jealousy, their arrogance or contemptuousness: but most commonly, their desires or fears for themselves their legitimate or illegitimate self-interest end_token wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of the morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and its feelings of class superiority end_token the morality between spartans and helots, between planters and negroes, between princes and subjects, between nobles and roturiers, between men and women, has been for the most part the creation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentiments thus generated, react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of the ascendant class, in their relations among themselves end_token where, on the other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority end_token another grand determining principle of the rules of conduct, both in act and forbearance, which have been enforced by law or opinion, has been the servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions of their temporal masters, or of their gods end_token this servility, though essentially selfish, is not hypocrisy; it gives rise to perfectly genuine sentiments of abhorrence; it made men burn magicians and heretics end_token among so many baser influences, the general and obvious interests of society have of course had a share, and a large one, in the direction of the moral sentiments: less, however, as a matter of reason, and on their own account, than as a consequence of the sympathies and antipathies which grew out of them: and sympathies and antipathies which had little or nothing to do with the interests of society, have made themselves felt in the establishment of moralities with quite as great force end_token the likings and dislikings of society, or of some powerful portion of it, are thus the main thing which has practically determined the rules laid down for general observance, under the penalties of law or opinion end_token and in general, those who have been in advance of society in thought and feeling have left this condition of things unassailed in principle, however they may have come into conflict with it in some of its details end_token they have occupied themselves rather in inquiring what things society ought to like or dislike, than in questioning whether its likings or dislikings should be a law to individuals end_token they preferred endeavouring to alter the feelings of mankind on the particular points on which they were themselves heretical, rather than make common cause in defence of freedom, with heretics generally end_token the only case in which the higher ground has been taken on principle and maintained with consistency, by any but an individual here and there, is that of religious belief: a case instructive in many ways, and not least so as forming a most striking instance of the fallibility of what is called the moral sense: for the odium theologicum, in a sincere bigot, is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling end_token those who first broke the yoke of what called itself the universal church, were in general as little willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that church itself end_token but when the heat of the conflict was over, without giving a complete victory to any party, and each church or sect was reduced to limit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it already occupied; minorities, seeing that they had no chance of becoming majorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those whom they could not convert, for permission to differ end_token it is accordingly on this battle-field, almost solely, that the rights of the individual against society have been asserted on broad grounds of principle, and the claim of society to exercise authority over dissentients, openly controverted end_token the great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty it possesses, have mostly asserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasible right, and denied absolutely that a human being is accountable to others for his religious belief end_token yet so natural to mankind is intolerance in whatever they really care about, that religious freedom has hardly anywhere been practically realised, except where religious indifference, which dislikes to have its peace disturbed by theological quarrels, has added its weight to the scale end_token in the minds of almost all religious persons, even in the most tolerant countries, the duty of toleration is admitted with tacit reserves end_token one person will bear with dissent in matters of church government, but not of dogma; another can tolerate everybody, short of a papist or a unitarian; another, every one who believes in revealed religion; a few extend their charity a little further, but stop at the belief in a god and in a future state end_token wherever the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense, it is found to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed end_token in england, from the peculiar circumstances of our political history, though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier, that of law is lighter, than in most other countries of europe; and there is considerable jealousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executive power, with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for the independence of the individual, as from the still subsisting habit of looking on the government as representing an opposite interest to the public end_token the majority have not yet learnt to feel the power of the government their power, or its opinions their opinions end_token when they do so, individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the government, as it already is from public opinion end_token but, as yet, there is a considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any attempt of the law to control individuals in things in which they have not hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it; and this with very little discrimination as to whether the matter is, or is not, within the legitimate sphere of legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highly salutary on the whole, is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well grounded in the particular instances of its application end_token there is, in fact, no recognised principle by which the propriety or impropriety of government interference is customarily tested end_token people decide according to their personal preferences end_token some, whenever they see any good to be done, or evil to be remedied, would willingly instigate the government to undertake the business; while others prefer to bear almost any amount of social evil, rather than add one to the departments of human interests amenable to governmental control end_token and men range themselves on one or the other side in any particular case, according to this general direction of their sentiments; or according to the degree of interest which they feel in the particular thing which it is proposed that the government should do, or according to the belief they entertain that the government would, or would not, do it in the manner they prefer; but very rarely on account of any opinion to which they consistently adhere, as to what things are fit to be done by a government end_token and it seems to me that in consequence of this absence of rule or principle, one side is at present as often wrong as the other; the interference of government is, with about equal frequency, improperly invoked and improperly condemned end_token the object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion end_token that principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection end_token that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others end_token his own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant end_token he cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right end_token these are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise end_token to justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else end_token the only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others end_token in the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute end_token over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign end_token it is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties end_token we are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood end_token those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury end_token for the same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage end_token the early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable end_token despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end end_token liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion end_token until then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an akbar or a charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one end_token but as soon as mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their own improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached in all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion, either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties for non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own good, and justifiable only for the security of others end_token it is proper to state that i forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing independent of utility end_token i regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being end_token those interests, i contend, authorise the subjection of individual spontaneity to external control, only in respect to those actions of each, which concern the interest of other people end_token if any one does an act hurtful to others, there is a primã¢ facie case for punishing him, by law, or, where legal penalties are not safely applicable, by general disapprobation end_token there are also many positive acts for the benefit of others, which he may rightfully be compelled to perform; such as, to give evidence in a court of justice; to bear his fair share in the common defence, or in any other joint work necessary to the interest of the society of which he enjoys the protection; and to perform certain acts of individual beneficence, such as saving a fellow-creature's life, or interposing to protect the defenceless against ill-usage, things which whenever it is obviously a man's duty to do, he may rightfully be made responsible to society for not doing end_token a person may cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury end_token the latter case, it is true, requires a much more cautious exercise of compulsion than the former end_token to make any one answerable for doing evil to others, is the rule; to make him answerable for not preventing evil, is, comparatively speaking, the exception end_token yet there are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify that exception end_token in all things which regard the external relations of the individual, he is de jure amenable to those whose interests are concerned, and if need be, to society as their protector end_token there are often good reasons for not holding him to the responsibility; but these reasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case: either because it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to act better, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled in any way in which society have it in their power to control him; or because the attempt to exercise control would produce other evils, greater than those which it would prevent end_token when such reasons as these preclude the enforcement of responsibility, the conscience of the agent himself should step into the vacant judgment seat, and protect those interests of others which have no external protection; judging himself all the more rigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made accountable to the judgment of his fellow-creatures end_token but there is a sphere of action in which society, as distinguished from the individual, has, if any, only an indirect interest; comprehending all that portion of a person's life and conduct which affects only himself, or if it also affects others, only with their free, voluntary, and undeceived consent and participation end_token when i say only himself, i mean directly, and in the first instance: for whatever affects himself, may affect others through himself; and the objection which may be grounded on this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel end_token this, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty end_token it comprises, first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological end_token the liberty of expressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a different principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual which concerns other people; but, being almost of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the same reasons, is practically inseparable from it end_token secondly, the principle requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow: without impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong end_token thirdly, from this liberty of each individual, follows the liberty, within the same limits, of combination among individuals; freedom to unite, for any purpose not involving harm to others: the persons combining being supposed to be of full age, and not forced or deceived end_token no society in which these liberties are not, on the whole, respected, is free, whatever may be its form of government; and none is completely free in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified end_token the only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it end_token each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual end_token mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest end_token though this doctrine is anything but new, and, to some persons, may have the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands more directly opposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and practice end_token society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according to its lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal, as of social excellence end_token the ancient commonwealths thought themselves entitled to practise, and the ancient philosophers countenanced, the regulation of every part of private conduct by public authority, on the ground that the state had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental discipline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which may have been admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies, in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and self-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford to wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom end_token in the modern world, the greater size of political communities, and above all, the separation between spiritual and temporal authority (which placed the direction of men's consciences in other hands than those which controlled their worldly affairs), prevented so great an interference by law in the details of private life; but the engines of moral repression have been wielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion in self-regarding, than even in social matters; religion, the most powerful of the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling, having almost always been governed either by the ambition of a hierarchy, seeking control over every department of human conduct, or by the spirit of puritanism end_token and some of those modern reformers who have placed themselves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past, have been noway behind either churches or sects in their assertion of the right of spiritual domination: m end_token comte, in particular, whose social system, as unfolded in his traitã© de politique positive, aims at establishing (though by moral more than by legal appliances) a despotism of society over the individual, surpassing anything contemplated in the political ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient philosophers end_token apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers, there is also in the world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the powers of society over the individual, both by the force of opinion and even by that of legislation: and as the tendency of all the changes taking place in the world is to strengthen society, and diminish the power of the individual, this encroachment is not one of the evils which tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more and more formidable end_token the disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as fellow-citizens to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it is hardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of power; and as the power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in the present circumstances of the world, to see it increase end_token it will be convenient for the argument, if, instead of at once entering upon the general thesis, we confine ourselves in the first instance to a single branch of it, on which the principle here stated is, if not fully, yet to a certain point, recognised by the current opinions end_token this one branch is the liberty of thought: from which it is impossible to separate the cognate liberty of speaking and of writing end_token although these liberties, to some considerable amount, form part of the political morality of all countries which profess religious toleration and free institutions, the grounds, both philosophical and practical, on which they rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the general mind, nor so thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion, as might have been expected end_token those grounds, when rightly understood, are of much wider application than to only one division of the subject, and a thorough consideration of this part of the question will be found the best introduction to the remainder end_token those to whom nothing which i am about to say will be new, may therefore, i hope, excuse me, if on a subject which for now three centuries has been so often discussed, i venture on one discussion more end_token of the liberty of thought and discussion end_token the time, it is to be hoped, is gone by, when any defence would be necessary of the \"liberty of the press\" as one of the securities against corrupt or tyrannical government end_token no argument, we may suppose, can now be needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, not identified in interest with the people, to prescribe opinions to them, and determine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed to hear end_token this aspect of the question, besides, has been so often and so triumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it need not be specially insisted on in this place end_token though the law of england, on the subject of the press, is as servile to this day as it was in the time of the tudors, there is little danger of its being actually put in force against political discussion, except during some temporary panic, when fear of insurrection drives ministers and judges from their propriety; and, speaking generally, it is not, in constitutional countries, to be apprehended that the government, whether completely responsible to the people or not, will often attempt to control the expression of opinion, except when in doing so it makes itself the organ of the general intolerance of the public end_token let us suppose, therefore, that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their voice end_token but i deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government end_token the power itself is illegitimate end_token the best government has no more title to it than the worst end_token it is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in or opposition to it end_token if all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind end_token were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many end_token but the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it end_token if the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error end_token it is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each of which has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it end_token we can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still end_token first: the opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may possibly be true end_token those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its truth; but they are not infallible end_token they have no authority to decide the question for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means of judging end_token to refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure that it is false, is to assume that their certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty end_token all silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility end_token its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common argument, not the worse for being common end_token unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment, which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition that any opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples of the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable end_token absolute princes, or others who are accustomed to unlimited deference, usually feel this complete confidence in their own opinions on nearly all subjects end_token people more happily situated, who sometimes hear their opinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be set right when they are wrong, place the same unbounded reliance only on such of their opinions as are shared by all who surround them, or to whom they habitually defer: for in proportion to a man's want of confidence in his own solitary judgment, does he usually repose, with implicit trust, on the infallibility of \"the world\" in general end_token and the world, to each individual, means the part of it with which he comes in contact; his party, his sect, his church, his class of society: the man may be called, by comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it means anything so comprehensive as his own country or his own age end_token nor is his faith in this collective authority at all shaken by his being aware that other ages, countries, sects, churches, classes, and parties have thought, and even now think, the exact reverse end_token he devolves upon his own world the responsibility of being in the right against the dissentient worlds of other people; and it never troubles him that mere accident has decided which of these numerous worlds is the object of his reliance, and that the same causes which make him a churchman in london, would have made him a buddhist or a confucian in pekin end_token yet it is as evident in itself as any amount of argument can make it, that ages are no more infallible than individuals; every age having held many opinions which subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd; and it is as certain that many opinions, now general, will be rejected by future ages, as it is that many, once general, are rejected by the present end_token the objection likely to be made to this argument, would probably take some such form as the following end_token there is no greater assumption of infallibility in forbidding the propagation of error, than in any other thing which is done by public authority on its own judgment and responsibility end_token judgment is given to men that they may use it end_token because it may be used erroneously, are men to be told that they ought not to use it at all? to prohibit what they think pernicious, is not claiming exemption from error, but fulfilling the duty incumbent on them, although fallible, of acting on their conscientious conviction end_token if we were never to act on our opinions, because those opinions may be wrong, we should leave all our interests uncared for, and all our duties unperformed end_token an objection which applies to all conduct, can be no valid objection to any conduct in particular end_token it is the duty of governments, and of individuals, to form the truest opinions they can; to form them carefully, and never impose them upon others unless they are quite sure of being right end_token but when they are sure (such reasoners may say), it is not conscientiousness but cowardice to shrink from acting on their opinions, and allow doctrines which they honestly think dangerous to the welfare of mankind, either in this life or in another, to be scattered abroad without restraint, because other people, in less enlightened times, have persecuted opinions now believed to be true end_token let us take care, it may be said, not to make the same mistake: but governments and nations have made mistakes in other things, which are not denied to be fit subjects for the exercise of authority: they have laid on bad taxes, made unjust wars end_token ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and, under whatever provocation, make no wars? men, and governments, must act to the best of their ability end_token there is no such thing as absolute certainty, but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of human life end_token we may, and must, assume our opinion to be true for the guidance of our own conduct: and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad men to pervert society by the propagation of opinions which we regard as false and pernicious end_token i answer that it is assuming very much more end_token there is the greatest difference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with every opportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its truth for the purpose of not permitting its refutation end_token complete liberty of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the very condition which justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action; and on no other terms can a being with human faculties have any rational assurance of being right end_token when we consider either the history of opinion, or the ordinary conduct of human life, to what is it to be ascribed that the one and the other are no worse than they are? not certainly to the inherent force of the human understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there are ninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of it, for one who is capable; and the capacity of the hundredth person is only comparative; for the majority of the eminent men of every past generation held many opinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerous things which no one will now justify end_token why is it, then, that there is on the whole a preponderance among mankind of rational opinions and rational conduct? if there really is this preponderance which there must be, unless human affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperate state it is owing to a quality of the human mind, the source of everything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral being, namely, that his errors are corrigible end_token he is capable of rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience end_token not by experience alone end_token there must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted end_token wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but facts and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it end_token very few facts are able to tell their own story, without comments to bring out their meaning end_token the whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one property, that it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand end_token in the case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it become so? because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and conduct end_token because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound to himself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious end_token because he has felt, that the only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind end_token no wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but this; nor is it in the nature of human intellect to become wise in any other manner end_token the steady habit of correcting and completing his own opinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubt and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable foundation for a just reliance on it: for, being cognisant of all that can, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up his position against all gainsayers knowing that he has sought for objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut out no light which can be thrown upon the subject from any quarter he has a right to think his judgment better than that of any person, or any multitude, who have not gone through a similar process end_token it is not too much to require that what the wisest of mankind, those who are best entitled to trust their own judgment, find necessary to warrant their relying on it, should be submitted to by that miscellaneous collection of a few wise and many foolish individuals, called the public end_token the most intolerant of churches, the roman catholic church, even at the canonisation of a saint, admits, and listens patiently to, a \"devil's advocate end_token\" the holiest of men, it appears, cannot be admitted to posthumous honours, until all that the devil could say against him is known and weighed end_token if even the newtonian philosophy were not permitted to be questioned, mankind could not feel as complete assurance of its truth as they now do end_token the beliefs which we have most warrant for, have no safeguard to rest on, but a standing invitation to the whole world to prove them unfounded end_token if the challenge is not accepted, or is accepted and the attempt fails, we are far enough from certainty still; but we have done the best that the existing state of human reason admits of; we have neglected nothing that could give the truth a chance of reaching us: if the lists are kept open, we may hope that if there be a better truth, it will be found when the human mind is capable of receiving it; and in the meantime we may rely on having attained such approach to truth, as is possible in our own day end_token this is the amount of certainty attainable by a fallible being, and this the sole way of attaining it end_token strange it is, that men should admit the validity of the arguments for free discussion, but object to their being \"pushed to an extreme;\" not seeing that unless the reasons are good for an extreme case, they are not good for any case end_token strange that they should imagine that they are not assuming infallibility, when they acknowledge that there should be free discussion on all subjects which can possibly be _doubtful_, but think that some particular principle or doctrine should be forbidden to be questioned because it is _so certain_, that is, because _they are certain_ that it is certain end_token to call any proposition certain, while there is any one who would deny its certainty if permitted, but who is not permitted, is to assume that we ourselves, and those who agree with us, are the judges of certainty, and judges without hearing the other side end_token in the present age which has been described as \"destitute of faith, but terrified at scepticism\" in which people feel sure, not so much that their opinions are true, as that they should not know what to do without them the claims of an opinion to be protected from public attack are rested not so much on its truth, as on its importance to society end_token there are, it is alleged, certain beliefs, so useful, not to say indispensable to well-being, that it is as much the duty of governments to uphold those beliefs, as to protect any other of the interests of society end_token in a case of such necessity, and so directly in the line of their duty, something less than infallibility may, it is maintained, warrant, and even bind, governments, to act on their own opinion, confirmed by the general opinion of mankind end_token it is also often argued, and still oftener thought, that none but bad men would desire to weaken these salutary beliefs; and there can be nothing wrong, it is thought, in restraining bad men, and prohibiting what only such men would wish to practise end_token this mode of thinking makes the justification of restraints on discussion not a question of the truth of doctrines, but of their usefulness; and flatters itself by that means to escape the responsibility of claiming to be an infallible judge of opinions end_token but those who thus satisfy themselves, do not perceive that the assumption of infallibility is merely shifted from one point to another end_token the usefulness of an opinion is itself matter of opinion: as disputable, as open to discussion, and requiring discussion as much, as the opinion itself end_token there is the same need of an infallible judge of opinions to decide an opinion to be noxious, as to decide it to be false, unless the opinion condemned has full opportunity of defending itself end_token and it will not do to say that the heretic may be allowed to maintain the utility or harmlessness of his opinion, though forbidden to maintain its truth end_token the truth of an opinion is part of its utility end_token if we would know whether or not it is desirable that a proposition should be believed, is it possible to exclude the consideration of whether or not it is true? in the opinion, not of bad men, but of the best men, no belief which is contrary to truth can be really useful: and can you prevent such men from urging that plea, when they are charged with culpability for denying some doctrine which they are told is useful, but which they believe to be false? those who are on the side of received opinions, never fail to take all possible advantage of this plea; you do not find them handling the question of utility as if it could be completely abstracted from that of truth: on the contrary, it is, above all, because their doctrine is \"the truth,\" that the knowledge or the belief of it is held to be so indispensable end_token there can be no fair discussion of the question of usefulness, when an argument so vital may be employed on one side, but not on the other end_token and in point of fact, when law or public feeling do not permit the truth of an opinion to be disputed, they are just as little tolerant of a denial of its usefulness end_token the utmost they allow is an extenuation of its absolute necessity, or of the positive guilt of rejecting it end_token in order more fully to illustrate the mischief of denying a hearing to opinions because we, in our own judgment, have condemned them, it will be desirable to fix down the discussion to a concrete case; and i choose, by preference, the cases which are least favourable to me in which the argument against freedom of opinion, both on the score of truth and on that of utility, is considered the strongest end_token let the opinions impugned be the belief in a god and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality end_token to fight the battle on such ground, gives a great advantage to an unfair antagonist; since he will be sure to say (and many who have no desire to be unfair will say it internally), are these the doctrines which you do not deem sufficiently certain to be taken under the protection of law? is the belief in a god one of the opinions, to feel sure of which, you hold to be assuming infallibility? but i must be permitted to observe, that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which i call an assumption of infallibility end_token it is the undertaking to decide that question _for others_, without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side end_token and i denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions end_token however positive any one's persuasion may be, not only of the falsity, but of the pernicious consequences not only of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which i altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of an opinion; yet if, in pursuance of that private judgment, though backed by the public judgment of his country or his contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility end_token and so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal end_token these are exactly the occasions on which the men of one generation commit those dreadful mistakes, which excite the astonishment and horror of posterity end_token it is among such that we find the instances memorable in history, when the arm of the law has been employed to root out the best men and the noblest doctrines; with deplorable success as to the men, though some of the doctrines have survived to be (as if in mockery) invoked, in defence of similar conduct towards those who dissent from _them_, or from their received interpretation end_token mankind can hardly be too often reminded that there was once a man named socrates, between whom and the legal authorities and public opinion of his time, there took place a memorable collision end_token born in an age and country abounding in individual greatness, this man has been handed down to us by those who best knew both him and the age, as the most virtuous man in it; while we know him as the head and prototype of all subsequent teachers of virtue, the source equally of the lofty inspiration of plato and the judicious utilitarianism of aristotle, \"_i maã«stri di color che sanno_,\" the two headsprings of ethical as of all other philosophy end_token this acknowledged master of all the eminent thinkers who have since lived whose fame, still growing after more than two thousand years, all but outweighs the whole remainder of the names which make his native city illustrious was put to death by his countrymen, after a judicial conviction, for impiety and immorality end_token impiety, in denying the gods recognised by the state; indeed his accuser asserted (see the \"apologia\") that he believed in no gods at all end_token immorality, in being, by his doctrines and instructions, a \"corruptor of youth end_token\" of these charges the tribunal, there is every ground for believing, honestly found him guilty, and condemned the man who probably of all then born had deserved best of mankind, to be put to death as a criminal end_token to pass from this to the only other instance of judicial iniquity, the mention of which, after the condemnation of socrates, would not be an anticlimax: the event which took place on calvary rather more than eighteen hundred years ago end_token the man who left on the memory of those who witnessed his life and conversation, such an impression of his moral grandeur, that eighteen subsequent centuries have done homage to him as the almighty in person, was ignominiously put to death, as what? as a blasphemer end_token men did not merely mistake their benefactor; they mistook him for the exact contrary of what he was, and treated him as that prodigy of impiety, which they themselves are now held to be, for their treatment of him end_token the feelings with which mankind now regard these lamentable transactions, especially the later of the two, render them extremely unjust in their judgment of the unhappy actors end_token these were, to all appearance, not bad men not worse than men commonly are, but rather the contrary; men who possessed in a full, or somewhat more than a full measure, the religious, moral, and patriotic feelings of their time and people: the very kind of men who, in all times, our own included, have every chance of passing through life blameless and respected end_token the high-priest who rent his garments when the words were pronounced, which, according to all the ideas of his country, constituted the blackest guilt, was in all probability quite as sincere in his horror and indignation, as the generality of respectable and pious men now are in the religious and moral sentiments they profess; and most of those who now shudder at his conduct, if they had lived in his time, and been born jews, would have acted precisely as he did end_token orthodox christians who are tempted to think that those who stoned to death the first martyrs must have been worse men than they themselves are, ought to remember that one of those persecutors was saint paul end_token let us add one more example, the most striking of all, if the impressiveness of an error is measured by the wisdom and virtue of him who falls into it end_token if ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for thinking himself the best and most enlightened among his cotemporaries, it was the emperor marcus aurelius end_token absolute monarch of the whole civilised world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished justice, but what was less to be expected from his stoical breeding, the tenderest heart end_token the few failings which are attributed to him, were all on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ at all, from the most characteristic teachings of christ end_token this man, a better christian in all but the dogmatic sense of the word, than almost any of the ostensibly christian sovereigns who have since reigned, persecuted christianity end_token placed at the summit of all the previous attainments of humanity, with an open, unfettered intellect, and a character which led him of himself to embody in his moral writings the christian ideal, he yet failed to see that christianity was to be a good and not an evil to the world, with his duties to which he was so deeply penetrated end_token existing society he knew to be in a deplorable state end_token but such as it was, he saw, or thought he saw, that it was held together, and prevented from being worse, by belief and reverence of the received divinities end_token as a ruler of mankind, he deemed it his duty not to suffer society to fall in pieces; and saw not how, if its existing ties were removed, any others could be formed which could again knit it together end_token the new religion openly aimed at dissolving these ties: unless, therefore, it was his duty to adopt that religion, it seemed to be his duty to put it down end_token inasmuch then as the theology of christianity did not appear to him true or of divine origin; inasmuch as this strange history of a crucified god was not credible to him, and a system which purported to rest entirely upon a foundation to him so wholly unbelievable, could not be foreseen by him to be that renovating agency which, after all abatements, it has in fact proved to be; the gentlest and most amiable of philosophers and rulers, under a solemn sense of duty, authorised the persecution of christianity end_token to my mind this is one of the most tragical facts in all history end_token it is a bitter thought, how different a thing the christianity of the world might have been, if the christian faith had been adopted as the religion of the empire under the auspices of marcus aurelius instead of those of constantine end_token but it would be equally unjust to him and false to truth, to deny, that no one plea which can be urged for punishing anti-christian teaching, was wanting to marcus aurelius for punishing, as he did, the propagation of christianity end_token no christian more firmly believes that atheism is false, and tends to the dissolution of society, than marcus aurelius believed the same things of christianity; he who, of all men then living, might have been thought the most capable of appreciating it end_token unless any one who approves of punishment for the promulgation of opinions, flatters himself that he is a wiser and better man than marcus aurelius more deeply versed in the wisdom of his time, more elevated in his intellect above it more earnest in his search for truth, or more single-minded in his devotion to it when found; let him abstain from that assumption of the joint infallibility of himself and the multitude, which the great antoninus made with so unfortunate a result end_token aware of the impossibility of defending the use of punishment for restraining irreligious opinions, by any argument which will not justify marcus antoninus, the enemies of religious freedom, when hard pressed, occasionally accept this consequence, and say, with dr end_token johnson, that the persecutors of christianity were in the right; that persecution is an ordeal through which truth ought to pass, and always passes successfully, legal penalties being, in the end, powerless against truth, though sometimes beneficially effective against mischievous errors end_token this is a form of the argument for religious intolerance, sufficiently remarkable not to be passed without notice end_token a theory which maintains that truth may justifiably be persecuted because persecution cannot possibly do it any harm, cannot be charged with being intentionally hostile to the reception of new truths; but we cannot commend the generosity of its dealing with the persons to whom mankind are indebted for them end_token to discover to the world something which deeply concerns it, and of which it was previously ignorant; to prove to it that it had been mistaken on some vital point of temporal or spiritual interest, is as important a service as a human being can render to his fellow-creatures, and in certain cases, as in those of the early christians and of the reformers, those who think with dr end_token johnson believe it to have been the most precious gift which could be bestowed on mankind end_token that the authors of such splendid benefits should be requited by martyrdom; that their reward should be to be dealt with as the vilest of criminals, is not, upon this theory, a deplorable error and misfortune, for which humanity should mourn in sackcloth and ashes, but the normal and justifiable state of things end_token the propounder of a new truth, according to this doctrine, should stand, as stood, in the legislation of the locrians, the proposer of a new law, with a halter round his neck, to be instantly tightened if the public assembly did not, on hearing his reasons, then and there adopt his proposition end_token people who defend this mode of treating benefactors, cannot be supposed to set much value on the benefit; and i believe this view of the subject is mostly confined to the sort of persons who think that new truths may have been desirable once, but that we have had enough of them now end_token but, indeed, the dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution, is one of those pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes end_token history teems with instances of truth put down by persecution end_token if not suppressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries end_token to speak only of religious opinions: the reformation broke out at least twenty times before luther, and was put down end_token arnold of brescia was put down end_token fra dolcino was put down end_token savonarola was put down end_token the albigeois were put down end_token the vaudois were put down end_token the lollards were put down end_token the hussites were put down end_token even after the era of luther, wherever persecution was persisted in, it was successful end_token in spain, italy, flanders, the austrian empire, protestantism was rooted out; and, most likely, would have been so in england, had queen mary lived, or queen elizabeth died end_token persecution has always succeeded, save where the heretics were too strong a party to be effectually persecuted end_token no reasonable person can doubt that christianity might have been extirpated in the roman empire end_token it spread, and became predominant, because the persecutions were only occasional, lasting but a short time, and separated by long intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism end_token it is a piece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any inherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and the stake end_token men are not more zealous for truth than they often are for error, and a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties will generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either end_token the real advantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion is true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the course of ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it, until some one of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourable circumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as to withstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it end_token it will be said, that we do not now put to death the introducers of new opinions: we are not like our fathers who slew the prophets, we even build sepulchres to them end_token it is true we no longer put heretics to death; and the amount of penal infliction which modern feeling would probably tolerate, even against the most obnoxious opinions, is not sufficient to extirpate them end_token but let us not flatter ourselves that we are yet free from the stain even of legal persecution end_token penalties for opinion, or at least for its expression, still exist by law; and their enforcement is not, even in these times, so unexampled as to make it at all incredible that they may some day be revived in full force end_token in the year 1857, at the summer assizes of the county of cornwall, an unfortunate man, said to be of unexceptionable conduct in all relations of life, was sentenced to twenty-one months' imprisonment, for uttering, and writing on a gate, some offensive words concerning christianity end_token within a month of the same time, at the old bailey, two persons, on two separate occasions, were rejected as jurymen, and one of them grossly insulted by the judge and by one of the counsel, because they honestly declared that they had no theological belief; and a third, a foreigner, for the same reason, was denied justice against a thief end_token this refusal of redress took place in virtue of the legal doctrine, that no person can be allowed to give evidence in a court of justice, who does not profess belief in a god (any god is sufficient) and in a future state; which is equivalent to declaring such persons to be outlaws, excluded from the protection of the tribunals; who may not only be robbed or assaulted with impunity, if no one but themselves, or persons of similar opinions, be present, but any one else may be robbed or assaulted with impunity, if the proof of the fact depends on their evidence end_token the assumption on which this is grounded, is that the oath is worthless, of a person who does not believe in a future state; a proposition which betokens much ignorance of history in those who assent to it (since it is historically true that a large proportion of infidels in all ages have been persons of distinguished integrity and honour); and would be maintained by no one who had the smallest conception how many of the persons in greatest repute with the world, both for virtues and for attainments, are well known, at least to their intimates, to be unbelievers end_token the rule, besides, is suicidal, and cuts away its own foundation end_token under pretence that atheists must be liars, it admits the testimony of all atheists who are willing to lie, and rejects only those who brave the obloquy of publicly confessing a detested creed rather than affirm a falsehood end_token a rule thus self-convicted of absurdity so far as regards its professed purpose, can be kept in force only as a badge of hatred, a relic of persecution; a persecution, too, having the peculiarity, that the qualification for undergoing it, is the being clearly proved not to deserve it end_token the rule, and the theory it implies, are hardly less insulting to believers than to infidels end_token for if he who does not believe in a future state, necessarily lies, it follows that they who do believe are only prevented from lying, if prevented they are, by the fear of hell end_token we will not do the authors and abettors of the rule the injury of supposing, that the conception which they have formed of christian virtue is drawn from their own consciousness end_token these, indeed, are but rags and remnants of persecution, and may be thought to be not so much an indication of the wish to persecute, as an example of that very frequent infirmity of english minds, which makes them take a preposterous pleasure in the assertion of a bad principle, when they are no longer bad enough to desire to carry it really into practice end_token but unhappily there is no security in the state of the public mind, that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution, which has lasted for about the space of a generation, will continue end_token in this age the quiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts to resuscitate past evils, as to introduce new benefits end_token what is boasted of at the present time as the revival of religion, is always, in narrow and uncultivated minds, at least as much the revival of bigotry; and where there is the strong permanent leaven of intolerance in the feelings of a people, which at all times abides in the middle classes of this country, it needs but little to provoke them into actively persecuting those whom they have never ceased to think proper objects of persecution end_token for it is this it is the opinions men entertain, and the feelings they cherish, respecting those who disown the beliefs they deem important, which makes this country not a place of mental freedom end_token for a long time past, the chief mischief of the legal penalties is that they strengthen the social stigma end_token it is that stigma which is really effective, and so effective is it that the profession of opinions which are under the ban of society is much less common in england, than is, in many other countries, the avowal of those which incur risk of judicial punishment end_token in respect to all persons but those whose pecuniary circumstances make them independent of the good will of other people, opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law; men might as well be imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread end_token those whose bread is already secured, and who desire no favours from men in power, or from bodies of men, or from the public, have nothing to fear from the open avowal of any opinions, but to be ill-thought of and ill-spoken of, and this it ought not to require a very heroic mould to enable them to bear end_token there is no room for any appeal _ad misericordiam_ in behalf of such persons end_token but though we do not now inflict so much evil on those who think differently from us, as it was formerly our custom to do, it may be that we do ourselves as much evil as ever by our treatment of them end_token socrates was put to death, but the socratic philosophy rose like the sun in heaven, and spread its illumination over the whole intellectual firmament end_token christians were cast to the lions, but the christian church grew up a stately and spreading tree, overtopping the older and less vigorous growths, and stifling them by its shade end_token our merely social intolerance kills no one, roots out no opinions, but induces men to disguise them, or to abstain from any active effort for their diffusion end_token with us, heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain, or even lose, ground in each decade or generation; they never blaze out far and wide, but continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and studious persons among whom they originate, without ever lighting up the general affairs of mankind with either a true or a deceptive light end_token and thus is kept up a state of things very satisfactory to some minds, because, without the unpleasant process of fining or imprisoning anybody, it maintains all prevailing opinions outwardly undisturbed, while it does not absolutely interdict the exercise of reason by dissentients afflicted with the malady of thought end_token a convenient plan for having peace in the intellectual world, and keeping all things going on therein very much as they do already end_token but the price paid for this sort of intellectual pacification, is the sacrifice of the entire moral courage of the human mind end_token a state of things in which a large portion of the most active and inquiring intellects find it advisable to keep the genuine principles and grounds of their convictions within their own breasts, and attempt, in what they address to the public, to fit as much as they can of their own conclusions to premises which they have internally renounced, cannot send forth the open, fearless characters, and logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the thinking world end_token the sort of men who can be looked for under it, are either mere conformers to commonplace, or time-servers for truth, whose arguments on all great subjects are meant for their hearers, and are not those which have convinced themselves end_token those who avoid this alternative, do so by narrowing their thoughts and interest to things which can be spoken of without venturing within the region of principles, that is, to small practical matters, which would come right of themselves, if but the minds of mankind were strengthened and enlarged, and which will never be made effectually right until then: while that which would strengthen and enlarge men's minds, free and daring speculation on the highest subjects, is abandoned end_token those in whose eyes this reticence on the part of heretics is no evil, should consider in the first place, that in consequence of it there is never any fair and thorough discussion of heretical opinions; and that such of them as could not stand such a discussion, though they may be prevented from spreading, do not disappear end_token but it is not the minds of heretics that are deteriorated most, by the ban placed on all inquiry which does not end in the orthodox conclusions end_token the greatest harm done is to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental development is cramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy end_token who can compute what the world loses in the multitude of promising intellects combined with timid characters, who dare not follow out any bold, vigorous, independent train of thought, lest it should land them in something which would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral? among them we may occasionally see some man of deep conscientiousness, and subtle and refined understanding, who spends a life in sophisticating with an intellect which he cannot silence, and exhausts the resources of ingenuity in attempting to reconcile the promptings of his conscience and reason with orthodoxy, which yet he does not, perhaps, to the end succeed in doing end_token no one can be a great thinker who does not recognise, that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead end_token truth gains more even by the errors of one who, with due study and preparation, thinks for himself, than by the true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think end_token not that it is solely, or chiefly, to form great thinkers, that freedom of thinking is required end_token on the contrary, it is as much, and even more indispensable, to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature which they are capable of end_token there have been, and may again be, great individual thinkers, in a general atmosphere of mental slavery end_token but there never has been, nor ever will be, in that atmosphere, an intellectually active people end_token where any people has made a temporary approach to such a character, it has been because the dread of heterodox speculation was for a time suspended end_token where there is a tacit convention that principles are not to be disputed; where the discussion of the greatest questions which can occupy humanity is considered to be closed, we cannot hope to find that generally high scale of mental activity which has made some periods of history so remarkable end_token never when controversy avoided the subjects which are large and important enough to kindle enthusiasm, was the mind of a people stirred up from its foundations, and the impulse given which raised even persons of the most ordinary intellect to something of the dignity of thinking beings end_token of such we have had an example in the condition of europe during the times immediately following the reformation; another, though limited to the continent and to a more cultivated class, in the speculative movement of the latter half of the eighteenth century; and a third, of still briefer duration, in the intellectual fermentation of germany during the goethian and fichtean period end_token these periods differed widely in the particular opinions which they developed; but were alike in this, that during all three the yoke of authority was broken end_token in each, an old mental despotism had been thrown off, and no new one had yet taken its place end_token the impulse given at these three periods has made europe what it now is end_token every single improvement which has taken place either in the human mind or in institutions, may be traced distinctly to one or other of them end_token appearances have for some time indicated that all three impulses are well-nigh spent; and we can expect no fresh start, until we again assert our mental freedom end_token let us now pass to the second division of the argument, and dismissing the supposition that any of the received opinions may be false, let us assume them to be true, and examine into the worth of the manner in which they are likely to be held, when their truth is not freely and openly canvassed end_token however unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be moved by the consideration that however true it may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth end_token there is a class of persons (happily not quite so numerous as formerly) who think it enough if a person assents undoubtingly to what they think true, though he has no knowledge whatever of the grounds of the opinion, and could not make a tenable defence of it against the most superficial objections end_token such persons, if they can once get their creed taught from authority, naturally think that no good, and some harm, comes of its being allowed to be questioned end_token where their influence prevails, they make it nearly impossible for the received opinion to be rejected wisely and considerately, though it may still be rejected rashly and ignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible, and when it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to give way before the slightest semblance of an argument end_token waiving, however, this possibility assuming that the true opinion abides in the mind, but abides as a prejudice, a belief independent of, and proof against, argument this is not the way in which truth ought to be held by a rational being end_token this is not knowing the truth end_token truth, thus held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunciate a truth end_token if the intellect and judgment of mankind ought to be cultivated, a thing which protestants at least do not deny, on what can these faculties be more appropriately exercised by any one, than on the things which concern him so much that it is considered necessary for him to hold opinions on them? if the cultivation of the understanding consists in one thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds of one's own opinions end_token whatever people believe, on subjects on which it is of the first importance to believe rightly, they ought to be able to defend against at least the common objections end_token but, some one may say, \"let them be taught the grounds of their opinions end_token it does not follow that opinions must be merely parroted because they are never heard controverted end_token persons who learn geometry do not simply commit the theorems to memory, but understand and learn likewise the demonstrations; and it would be absurd to say that they remain ignorant of the grounds of geometrical truths, because they never hear any one deny, and attempt to disprove them end_token\" undoubtedly: and such teaching suffices on a subject like mathematics, where there is nothing at all to be said on the wrong side of the question end_token the peculiarity of the evidence of mathematical truths is, that all the argument is on one side end_token there are no objections, and no answers to objections end_token but on every subject on which difference of opinion is possible, the truth depends on a balance to be struck between two sets of conflicting reasons end_token even in natural philosophy, there is always some other explanation possible of the same facts; some geocentric theory instead of heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxygen; and it has to be shown why that other theory cannot be the true one: and until this is shown, and until we know how it is shown, we do not understand the grounds of our opinion end_token but when we turn to subjects infinitely more complicated, to morals, religion, politics, social relations, and the business of life, three-fourths of the arguments for every disputed opinion consist in dispelling the appearances which favour some opinion different from it end_token the greatest orator, save one, of antiquity, has left it on record that he always studied his adversary's case with as great, if not with still greater, intensity than even his own end_token what cicero practised as the means of forensic success, requires to be imitated by all who study any subject in order to arrive at the truth end_token he who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that end_token his reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them end_token but if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion end_token the rational position for him would be suspension of judgment, and unless he contents himself with that, he is either led by authority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side to which he feels most inclination end_token nor is it enough that he should hear the arguments of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations end_token that is not the way to do justice to the arguments, or bring them into real contact with his own mind end_token he must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them; who defend them in earnest, and do their very utmost for them end_token he must know them in their most plausible and persuasive form; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty which the true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of; else he will never really possess himself of the portion of truth which meets and removes that difficulty end_token ninety-nine in a hundred of what are called educated men are in this condition; even of those who can argue fluently for their opinions end_token their conclusion may be true, but it might be false for anything they know: they have never thrown themselves into the mental position of those who think differently from them, and considered what such persons may have to say; and consequently they do not, in any proper sense of the word, know the doctrine which they themselves profess end_token they do not know those parts of it which explain and justify the remainder; the considerations which show that a fact which seemingly conflicts with another is reconcilable with it, or that, of two apparently strong reasons, one and not the other ought to be preferred end_token all that part of the truth which turns the scale, and decides the judgment of a completely informed mind, they are strangers to; nor is it ever really known, but to those who have attended equally and impartially to both sides, and endeavoured to see the reasons of both in the strongest light end_token so essential is this discipline to a real understanding of moral and human subjects, that if opponents of all important truths do not exist, it is indispensable to imagine them, and supply them with the strongest arguments which the most skilful devil's advocate can conjure up end_token to abate the force of these considerations, an enemy of free discussion may be supposed to say, that there is no necessity for mankind in general to know and understand all that can be said against or for their opinions by philosophers and theologians end_token that it is not needful for common men to be able to expose all the misstatements or fallacies of an ingenious opponent end_token that it is enough if there is always somebody capable of answering them, so that nothing likely to mislead uninstructed persons remains unrefuted end_token that simple minds, having been taught the obvious grounds of the truths inculcated on them, may trust to authority for the rest, and being aware that they have neither knowledge nor talent to resolve every difficulty which can be raised, may repose in the assurance that all those which have been raised have been or can be answered, by those who are specially trained to the task end_token conceding to this view of the subject the utmost that can be claimed for it by those most easily satisfied with the amount of understanding of truth which ought to accompany the belief of it; even so, the argument for free discussion is no way weakened end_token for even this doctrine acknowledges that mankind ought to have a rational assurance that all objections have been satisfactorily answered; and how are they to be answered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken? or how can the answer be known to be satisfactory, if the objectors have no opportunity of showing that it is unsatisfactory? if not the public, at least the philosophers and theologians who are to resolve the difficulties, must make themselves familiar with those difficulties in their most puzzling form; and this cannot be accomplished unless they are freely stated, and placed in the most advantageous light which they admit of end_token the catholic church has its own way of dealing with this embarrassing problem end_token it makes a broad separation between those who can be permitted to receive its doctrines on conviction, and those who must accept them on trust end_token neither, indeed, are allowed any choice as to what they will accept; but the clergy, such at least as can be fully confided in, may admissibly and meritoriously make themselves acquainted with the arguments of opponents, in order to answer them, and may, therefore, read heretical books; the laity, not unless by special permission, hard to be obtained end_token this discipline recognises a knowledge of the enemy's case as beneficial to the teachers, but finds means, consistent with this, of denying it to the rest of the world: thus giving to the ã©lite more mental culture, though not more mental freedom, than it allows to the mass end_token by this device it succeeds in obtaining the kind of mental superiority which its purposes require; for though culture without freedom never made a large and liberal mind, it can make a clever _nisi prius_ advocate of a cause end_token but in countries professing protestantism, this resource is denied; since protestants hold, at least in theory, that the responsibility for the choice of a religion must be borne by each for himself, and cannot be thrown off upon teachers end_token besides, in the present state of the world, it is practically impossible that writings which are read by the instructed can be kept from the uninstructed end_token if the teachers of mankind are to be cognisant of all that they ought to know, everything must be free to be written and published without restraint end_token if, however, the mischievous operation of the absence of free discussion, when the received opinions are true, were confined to leaving men ignorant of the grounds of those opinions, it might be thought that this, if an intellectual, is no moral evil, and does not affect the worth of the opinions, regarded in their influence on the character end_token the fact, however, is, that not only the grounds of the opinion are forgotten in the absence of discussion, but too often the meaning of the opinion itself end_token the words which convey it, cease to suggest ideas, or suggest only a small portion of those they were originally employed to communicate end_token instead of a vivid conception and a living belief, there remain only a few phrases retained by rote; or, if any part, the shell and husk only of the meaning is retained, the finer essence being lost end_token the great chapter in human history which this fact occupies and fills, cannot be too earnestly studied and meditated on end_token it is illustrated in the experience of almost all ethical doctrines and religious creeds end_token they are all full of meaning and vitality to those who originate them, and to the direct disciples of the originators end_token their meaning continues to be felt in undiminished strength, and is perhaps brought out into even fuller consciousness, so long as the struggle lasts to give the doctrine or creed an ascendency over other creeds end_token at last it either prevails, and becomes the general opinion, or its progress stops; it keeps possession of the ground it has gained, but ceases to spread further end_token when either of these results has become apparent, controversy on the subject flags, and gradually dies away end_token the doctrine has taken its place, if not as a received opinion, as one of the admitted sects or divisions of opinion: those who hold it have generally inherited, not adopted it; and conversion from one of these doctrines to another, being now an exceptional fact, occupies little place in the thoughts of their professors end_token instead of being, as at first, constantly on the alert either to defend themselves against the world, or to bring the world over to them, they have subsided into acquiescence, and neither listen, when they can help it, to arguments against their creed, nor trouble dissentients (if there be such) with arguments in its favour end_token from this time may usually be dated the decline in the living power of the doctrine end_token we often hear the teachers of all creeds lamenting the difficulty of keeping up in the minds of believers a lively apprehension of the truth which they nominally recognise, so that it may penetrate the feelings, and acquire a real mastery over the conduct end_token no such difficulty is complained of while the creed is still fighting for its existence: even the weaker combatants then know and feel what they are fighting for, and the difference between it and other doctrines; and in that period of every creed's existence, not a few persons may be found, who have realised its fundamental principles in all the forms of thought, have weighed and considered them in all their important bearings, and have experienced the full effect on the character, which belief in that creed ought to produce in a mind thoroughly imbued with it end_token but when it has come to be a hereditary creed, and to be received passively, not actively when the mind is no longer compelled, in the same degree as at first, to exercise its vital powers on the questions which its belief presents to it, there is a progressive tendency to forget all of the belief except the formularies, or to give it a dull and torpid assent, as if accepting it on trust dispensed with the necessity of realising it in consciousness, or testing it by personal experience; until it almost ceases to connect itself at all with the inner life of the human being end_token then are seen the cases, so frequent in this age of the world as almost to form the majority, in which the creed remains as it were outside the mind, encrusting and petrifying it against all other influences addressed to the higher parts of our nature; manifesting its power by not suffering any fresh and living conviction to get in, but itself doing nothing for the mind or heart, except standing sentinel over them to keep them vacant end_token to what an extent doctrines intrinsically fitted to make the deepest impression upon the mind may remain in it as dead beliefs, without being ever realised in the imagination, the feelings, or the understanding, is exemplified by the manner in which the majority of believers hold the doctrines of christianity end_token by christianity i here mean what is accounted such by all churches and sects the maxims and precepts contained in the new testament end_token these are considered sacred, and accepted as laws, by all professing christians end_token yet it is scarcely too much to say that not one christian in a thousand guides or tests his individual conduct by reference to those laws end_token the standard to which he does refer it, is the custom of his nation, his class, or his religious profession end_token he has thus, on the one hand, a collection of ethical maxims, which he believes to have been vouchsafed to him by infallible wisdom as rules for his government; and on the other, a set of every-day judgments and practices, which go a certain length with some of those maxims, not so great a length with others, stand in direct opposition to some, and are, on the whole, a compromise between the christian creed and the interests and suggestions of worldly life end_token to the first of these standards he gives his homage; to the other his real allegiance end_token all christians believe that the blessed are the poor and humble, and those who are ill-used by the world; that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven; that they should judge not, lest they be judged; that they should swear not at all; that they should love their neighbour as themselves; that if one take their cloak, they should give him their coat also; that they should take no thought for the morrow; that if they would be perfect, they should sell all that they have and give it to the poor end_token they are not insincere when they say that they believe these things end_token they do believe them, as people believe what they have always heard lauded and never discussed end_token but in the sense of that living belief which regulates conduct, they believe these doctrines just up to the point to which it is usual to act upon them end_token the doctrines in their integrity are serviceable to pelt adversaries with; and it is understood that they are to be put forward (when possible) as the reasons for whatever people do that they think laudable end_token but any one who reminded them that the maxims require an infinity of things which they never even think of doing, would gain nothing but to be classed among those very unpopular characters who affect to be better than other people end_token the doctrines have no hold on ordinary believers are not a power in their minds end_token they have a habitual respect for the sound of them, but no feeling which spreads from the words to the things signified, and forces the mind to take them in, and make them conform to the formula end_token whenever conduct is concerned, they look round for mr end_token a and b to direct them how far to go in obeying christ end_token now we may be well assured that the case was not thus, but far otherwise, with the early christians end_token had it been thus, christianity never would have expanded from an obscure sect of the despised hebrews into the religion of the roman empire end_token when their enemies said, \"see how these christians love one another\" (a remark not likely to be made by anybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the meaning of their creed than they have ever had since end_token and to this cause, probably, it is chiefly owing that christianity now makes so little progress in extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries, is still nearly confined to europeans and the descendants of europeans end_token even with the strictly religious, who are much in earnest about their doctrines, and attach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than people in general, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparatively active in their minds is that which was made by calvin, or knox, or some such person much nearer in character to themselves end_token the sayings of christ coexist passively in their minds, producing hardly any effect beyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland end_token there are many reasons, doubtless, why doctrines which are the badge of a sect retain more of their vitality than those common to all recognised sects, and why more pains are taken by teachers to keep their meaning alive; but one reason certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are more questioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers end_token both teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as there is no enemy in the field end_token the same thing holds true, generally speaking, of all traditional doctrines those of prudence and knowledge of life, as well as of morals or religion end_token all languages and literatures are full of general observations on life, both as to what it is, and how to conduct oneself in it; observations which everybody knows, which everybody repeats, or hears with acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of which most people first truly learn the meaning, when experience, generally of a painful kind, has made it a reality to them end_token how often, when smarting under some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment, does a person call to mind some proverb or common saying, familiar to him all his life, the meaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now, would have saved him from the calamity end_token there are indeed reasons for this, other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths of which the full meaning cannot be realised, until personal experience has brought it home end_token but much more of the meaning even of these would have been understood, and what was understood would have been far more deeply impressed on the mind, if the man had been accustomed to hear it argued pro and con by people who did understand it end_token the fatal tendency of mankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer doubtful, is the cause of half their errors end_token a contemporary author has well spoken of \"the deep slumber of a decided opinion end_token\" but what! (it may be asked) is the absence of unanimity an indispensable condition of true knowledge? is it necessary that some part of mankind should persist in error, to enable any to realise the truth? does a belief cease to be real and vital as soon as it is generally received and is a proposition never thoroughly understood and felt unless some doubt of it remains? as soon as mankind have unanimously accepted a truth, does the truth perish within them? the highest aim and best result of improved intelligence, it has hitherto been thought, is to unite mankind more and more in the acknowledgment of all important truths: and does the intelligence only last as long as it has not achieved its object? do the fruits of conquest perish by the very completeness of the victory? i affirm no such thing end_token as mankind improve, the number of doctrines which are no longer disputed or doubted will be constantly on the increase: and the well-being of mankind may almost be measured by the number and gravity of the truths which have reached the point of being uncontested end_token the cessation, on one question after another, of serious controversy, is one of the necessary incidents of the consolidation of opinion; a consolidation as salutary in the case of true opinions, as it is dangerous and noxious when the opinions are erroneous end_token but though this gradual narrowing of the bounds of diversity of opinion is necessary in both senses of the term, being at once inevitable and indispensable, we are not therefore obliged to conclude that all its consequences must be beneficial end_token the loss of so important an aid to the intelligent and living apprehension of a truth, as is afforded by the necessity of explaining it to, or defending it against, opponents, though not sufficient to outweigh, is no trifling drawback from, the benefit of its universal recognition end_token where this advantage can no longer be had, i confess i should like to see the teachers of mankind endeavouring to provide a substitute for it; some contrivance for making the difficulties of the question as present to the learner's consciousness, as if they were pressed upon him by a dissentient champion, eager for his conversion end_token but instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose, they have lost those they formerly had end_token the socratic dialectics, so magnificently exemplified in the dialogues of plato, were a contrivance of this description end_token they were essentially a negative discussion of the great questions of philosophy and life, directed with consummate skill to the purpose of convincing any one who had merely adopted the commonplaces of received opinion, that he did not understand the subject that he as yet attached no definite meaning to the doctrines he professed; in order that, becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in the way to attain a stable belief, resting on a clear apprehension both of the meaning of doctrines and of their evidence end_token the school disputations of the middle ages had a somewhat similar object end_token they were intended to make sure that the pupil understood his own opinion, and (by necessary correlation) the opinion opposed to it, and could enforce the grounds of the one and confute those of the other end_token these last-mentioned contests had indeed the incurable defect, that the premises appealed to were taken from authority, not from reason; and, as a discipline to the mind, they were in every respect inferior to the powerful dialectics which formed the intellects of the \"socratici viri\": but the modern mind owes far more to both than it is generally willing to admit, and the present modes of education contain nothing which in the smallest degree supplies the place either of the one or of the other end_token a person who derives all his instruction from teachers or books, even if he escape the besetting temptation of contenting himself with cram, is under no compulsion to hear both sides; accordingly it is far from a frequent accomplishment, even among thinkers, to know both sides; and the weakest part of what everybody says in defence of his opinion, is what he intends as a reply to antagonists end_token it is the fashion of the present time to disparage negative logic that which points out weaknesses in theory or errors in practice, without establishing positive truths end_token such negative criticism would indeed be poor enough as an ultimate result; but as a means to attaining any positive knowledge or conviction worthy the name, it cannot be valued too highly; and until people are again systematically trained to it, there will be few great thinkers, and a low general average of intellect, in any but the mathematical and physical departments of speculation end_token on any other subject no one's opinions deserve the name of knowledge, except so far as he has either had forced upon him by others, or gone through of himself, the same mental process which would have been required of him in carrying on an active controversy with opponents end_token that, therefore, which when absent, it is so indispensable, but so difficult, to create, how worse than absurd is it to forego, when spontaneously offering itself! if there are any persons who contest a received opinion, or who will do so if law or opinion will let them, let us thank them for it, open our minds to listen to them, and rejoice that there is some one to do for us what we otherwise ought, if we have any regard for either the certainty or the vitality of our convictions, to do with much greater labour for ourselves end_token it still remains to speak of one of the principal causes which make diversity of opinion advantageous, and will continue to do so until mankind shall have entered a stage of intellectual advancement which at present seems at an incalculable distance end_token we have hitherto considered only two possibilities: that the received opinion may be false, and some other opinion, consequently, true; or that, the received opinion being true, a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clear apprehension and deep feeling of its truth end_token but there is a commoner case than either of these; when the conflicting doctrines, instead of being one true and the other false, share the truth between them; and the nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder of the truth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part end_token popular opinions, on subjects not palpable to sense, are often true, but seldom or never the whole truth end_token they are a part of the truth; sometimes a greater, sometimes a smaller part, but exaggerated, distorted, and disjoined from the truths by which they ought to be accompanied and limited end_token heretical opinions, on the other hand, are generally some of these suppressed and neglected truths, bursting the bonds which kept them down, and either seeking reconciliation with the truth contained in the common opinion, or fronting it as enemies, and setting themselves up, with similar exclusiveness, as the whole truth end_token the latter case is hitherto the most frequent, as, in the human mind, one-sidedness has always been the rule, and many-sidedness the exception end_token hence, even in revolutions of opinion, one part of the truth usually sets while another rises end_token even progress, which ought to superadd, for the most part only substitutes one partial and incomplete truth for another; improvement consisting chiefly in this, that the new fragment of truth is more wanted, more adapted to the needs of the time, than that which it displaces end_token such being the partial character of prevailing opinions, even when resting on a true foundation; every opinion which embodies somewhat of the portion of truth which the common opinion omits, ought to be considered precious, with whatever amount of error and confusion that truth may be blended end_token no sober judge of human affairs will feel bound to be indignant because those who force on our notice truths which we should otherwise have overlooked, overlook some of those which we see end_token rather, he will think that so long as popular truth is one-sided, it is more desirable than otherwise that unpopular truth should have one-sided asserters too; such being usually the most energetic, and the most likely to compel reluctant attention to the fragment of wisdom which they proclaim as if it were the whole end_token thus, in the eighteenth century, when nearly all the instructed, and all those of the uninstructed who were led by them, were lost in admiration of what is called civilisation, and of the marvels of modern science, literature, and philosophy, and while greatly overrating the amount of unlikeness between the men of modern and those of ancient times, indulged the belief that the whole of the difference was in their own favour; with what a salutary shock did the paradoxes of rousseau explode like bombshells in the midst, dislocating the compact mass of one-sided opinion, and forcing its elements to recombine in a better form and with additional ingredients end_token not that the current opinions were on the whole farther from the truth than rousseau's were; on the contrary, they were nearer to it; they contained more of positive truth, and very much less of error end_token nevertheless there lay in rousseau's doctrine, and has floated down the stream of opinion along with it, a considerable amount of exactly those truths which the popular opinion wanted; and these are the deposit which was left behind when the flood subsided end_token the superior worth of simplicity of life, the enervating and demoralising effect of the trammels and hypocrisies of artificial society, are ideas which have never been entirely absent from cultivated minds since rousseau wrote; and they will in time produce their due effect, though at present needing to be asserted as much as ever, and to be asserted by deeds, for words, on this subject, have nearly exhausted their power end_token in politics, again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of order or stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary elements of a healthy state of political life; until the one or the other shall have so enlarged its mental grasp as to be a party equally of order and of progress, knowing and distinguishing what is fit to be preserved from what ought to be swept away end_token each of these modes of thinking derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other; but it is in a great measure the opposition of the other that keeps each within the limits of reason and sanity end_token unless opinions favourable to democracy and to aristocracy, to property and to equality, to co-operation and to competition, to luxury and to abstinence, to sociality and individuality, to liberty and discipline, and all the other standing antagonisms of practical life, are expressed with equal freedom, and enforced and defended with equal talent and energy, there is no chance of both elements obtaining their due; one scale is sure to go up and the other down end_token truth, in the great practical concerns of life, is so much a question of the reconciling and combining of opposites, that very few have minds sufficiently capacious and impartial to make the adjustment with an approach to correctness, and it has to be made by the rough process of a struggle between combatants fighting under hostile banners end_token on any of the great open questions just enumerated, if either of the two opinions has a better claim than the other, not merely to be tolerated, but to be encouraged and countenanced, it is the one which happens at the particular time and place to be in a minority end_token that is the opinion which, for the time being, represents the neglected interests, the side of human well-being which is in danger of obtaining less than its share end_token i am aware that there is not, in this country, any intolerance of differences of opinion on most of these topics end_token they are adduced to show, by admitted and multiplied examples, the universality of the fact, that only through diversity of opinion is there, in the existing state of human intellect, a chance of fair-play to all sides of the truth end_token when there are persons to be found, who form an exception to the apparent unanimity of the world on any subject, even if the world is in the right, it is always probable that dissentients have something worth hearing to say for themselves, and that truth would lose something by their silence end_token it may be objected, \"but some received principles, especially on the highest and most vital subjects, are more than half-truths end_token the christian morality, for instance, is the whole truth on that subject, and if any one teaches a morality which varies from it, he is wholly in error end_token\" as this is of all cases the most important in practice, none can be fitter to test the general maxim end_token but before pronouncing what christian morality is or is not, it would be desirable to decide what is meant by christian morality end_token if it means the morality of the new testament, i wonder that any one who derives his knowledge of this from the book itself, can suppose that it was announced, or intended, as a complete doctrine of morals end_token the gospel always refers to a pre-existing morality, and confines its precepts to the particulars in which that morality was to be corrected, or superseded by a wider and higher; expressing itself, moreover, in terms most general, often impossible to be interpreted literally, and possessing rather the impressiveness of poetry or eloquence than the precision of legislation end_token to extract from it a body of ethical doctrine, has ever been possible without eking it out from the old testament, that is, from a system elaborate indeed, but in many respects barbarous, and intended only for a barbarous people end_token st end_token paul, a declared enemy to this judaical mode of interpreting the doctrine and filling up the scheme of his master, equally assumes a pre-existing morality, namely, that of the greeks and romans; and his advice to christians is in a great measure a system of accommodation to that; even to the extent of giving an apparent sanction to slavery end_token what is called christian, but should rather be termed theological, morality, was not the work of christ or the apostles, but is of much later origin, having been gradually built up by the catholic church of the first five centuries, and though not implicitly adopted by moderns and protestants, has been much less modified by them than might have been expected end_token for the most part, indeed, they have contented themselves with cutting off the additions which had been made to it in the middle ages, each sect supplying the place by fresh additions, adapted to its own character and tendencies end_token that mankind owe a great debt to this morality, and to its early teachers, i should be the last person to deny; but i do not scruple to say of it, that it is, in many important points, incomplete and one-sided, and that unless ideas and feelings, not sanctioned by it, had contributed to the formation of european life and character, human affairs would have been in a worse condition than they now are end_token christian morality (so called) has all the characters of a reaction; it is, in great part, a protest against paganism end_token its ideal is negative rather than positive; passive rather than active; innocence rather than nobleness; abstinence from evil, rather than energetic pursuit of good: in its precepts (as has been well said) \"thou shalt not\" predominates unduly over \"thou shalt end_token\" in its horror of sensuality, it made an idol of asceticism, which has been gradually compromised away into one of legality end_token it holds out the hope of heaven and the threat of hell, as the appointed and appropriate motives to a virtuous life: in this falling far below the best of the ancients, and doing what lies in it to give to human morality an essentially selfish character, by disconnecting each man's feelings of duty from the interests of his fellow-creatures, except so far as a self-interested inducement is offered to him for consulting them end_token it is essentially a doctrine of passive obedience; it inculcates submission to all authorities found established; who indeed are not to be actively obeyed when they command what religion forbids, but who are not to be resisted, far less rebelled against, for any amount of wrong to ourselves end_token and while, in the morality of the best pagan nations, duty to the state holds even a disproportionate place, infringing on the just liberty of the individual; in purely christian ethics, that grand department of duty is scarcely noticed or acknowledged end_token it is in the koran, not the new testament, that we read the maxim \"a ruler who appoints any man to an office, when there is in his dominions another man better qualified for it, sins against god and against the state end_token\" what little recognition the idea of obligation to the public obtains in modern morality, is derived from greek and roman sources, not from christian; as, even in the morality of private life, whatever exists of magnanimity, high-mindedness, personal dignity, even the sense of honour, is derived from the purely human, not the religious part of our education, and never could have grown out of a standard of ethics in which the only worth, professedly recognised, is that of obedience end_token i am as far as any one from pretending that these defects are necessarily inherent in the christian ethics, in every manner in which it can be conceived, or that the many requisites of a complete moral doctrine which it does not contain, do not admit of being reconciled with it end_token far less would i insinuate this of the doctrines and precepts of christ himself end_token i believe that the sayings of christ are all, that i can see any evidence of their having been intended to be; that they are irreconcilable with nothing which a comprehensive morality requires; that everything which is excellent in ethics may be brought within them, with no greater violence to their language than has been done to it by all who have attempted to deduce from them any practical system of conduct whatever end_token but it is quite consistent with this, to believe that they contain, and were meant to contain, only a part of the truth; that many essential elements of the highest morality are among the things which are not provided for, nor intended to be provided for, in the recorded deliverances of the founder of christianity, and which have been entirely thrown aside in the system of ethics erected on the basis of those deliverances by the christian church end_token and this being so, i think it a great error to persist in attempting to find in the christian doctrine that complete rule for our guidance, which its author intended it to sanction and enforce, but only partially to provide end_token i believe, too, that this narrow theory is becoming a grave practical evil, detracting greatly from the value of the moral training and instruction, which so many well-meaning persons are now at length exerting themselves to promote end_token i much fear that by attempting to form the mind and feelings on an exclusively religious type, and discarding those secular standards (as for want of a better name they may be called) which heretofore co-existed with and supplemented the christian ethics, receiving some of its spirit, and infusing into it some of theirs, there will result, and is even now resulting, a low, abject, servile type of character, which, submit itself as it may to what it deems the supreme will, is incapable of rising to or sympathising in the conception of supreme goodness end_token i believe that other ethics than any which can be evolved from exclusively christian sources, must exist side by side with christian ethics to produce the moral regeneration of mankind; and that the christian system is no exception to the rule, that in an imperfect state of the human mind, the interests of truth require a diversity of opinions end_token it is not necessary that in ceasing to ignore the moral truths not contained in christianity, men should ignore any of those which it does contain end_token such prejudice, or oversight, when it occurs, is altogether an evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always exempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good end_token the exclusive pretension made by a part of the truth to be the whole, must and ought to be protested against, and if a reactionary impulse should make the protestors unjust in their turn, this one-sidedness, like the other, may be lamented, but must be tolerated end_token if christians would teach infidels to be just to christianity, they should themselves be just to infidelity end_token it can do truth no service to blink the fact, known to all who have the most ordinary acquaintance with literary history, that a large portion of the noblest and most valuable moral teaching has been the work, not only of men who did not know, but of men who knew and rejected, the christian faith end_token i do not pretend that the most unlimited use of the freedom of enunciating all possible opinions would put an end to the evils of religious or philosophical sectarianism end_token every truth which men of narrow capacity are in earnest about, is sure to be asserted, inculcated, and in many ways even acted on, as if no other truth existed in the world, or at all events none that could limit or qualify the first end_token i acknowledge that the tendency of all opinions to become sectarian is not cured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated thereby; the truth which ought to have been, but was not, seen, being rejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons regarded as opponents end_token but it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the calmer and more disinterested bystander, that this collision of opinions works its salutary effect end_token not the violent conflict between parts of the truth, but the quiet suppression of half of it, is the formidable evil: there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides; it is when they attend only to one that errors harden into prejudices, and truth itself ceases to have the effect of truth, by being exaggerated into falsehood end_token and since there are few mental attributes more rare than that judicial faculty which can sit in intelligent judgment between two sides of a question, of which only one is represented by an advocate before it, truth has no chance but in proportion as every side of it, every opinion which embodies any fraction of the truth, not only finds advocates, but is so advocated as to be listened to end_token we have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind (on which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, and freedom of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we will now briefly recapitulate end_token first, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true end_token to deny this is to assume our own infallibility end_token secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions, that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied end_token thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds end_token and not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience end_token before quitting the subject of freedom of opinion, it is fit to take some notice of those who say, that the free expression of all opinions should be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and do not pass the bounds of fair discussion end_token much might be said on the impossibility of fixing where these supposed bounds are to be placed; for if the test be offence to those whose opinion is attacked, i think experience testifies that this offence is given whenever the attack is telling and powerful, and that every opponent who pushes them hard, and whom they find it difficult to answer, appears to them, if he shows any strong feeling on the subject, an intemperate opponent end_token but this, though an important consideration in a practical point of view, merges in a more fundamental objection end_token undoubtedly the manner of asserting an opinion, even though it be a true one, may be very objectionable, and may justly incur severe censure end_token but the principal offences of the kind are such as it is mostly impossible, unless by accidental self-betrayal, to bring home to conviction end_token the gravest of them is, to argue sophistically, to suppress facts or arguments, to misstate the elements of the case, or misrepresent the opposite opinion end_token but all this, even to the most aggravated degree, is so continually done in perfect good faith, by persons who are not considered, and in many other respects may not deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent, that it is rarely possible on adequate grounds conscientiously to stamp the misrepresentation as morally culpable; and still less could law presume to interfere with this kind of controversial misconduct end_token with regard to what is commonly meant by intemperate discussion, namely invective, sarcasm, personality, and the like, the denunciation of these weapons would deserve more sympathy if it were ever proposed to interdict them equally to both sides; but it is only desired to restrain the employment of them against the prevailing opinion: against the unprevailing they may not only be used without general disapproval, but will be likely to obtain for him who uses them the praise of honest zeal and righteous indignation end_token yet whatever mischief arises from their use, is greatest when they are employed against the comparatively defenceless; and whatever unfair advantage can be derived by any opinion from this mode of asserting it, accrues almost exclusively to received opinions end_token the worst offence of this kind which can be committed by a polemic, is to stigmatise those who hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men end_token to calumny of this sort, those who hold any unpopular opinion are peculiarly exposed, because they are in general few and uninfluential, and nobody but themselves feel much interest in seeing justice done them; but this weapon is, from the nature of the case, denied to those who attack a prevailing opinion: they can neither use it with safety to themselves, nor, if they could, would it do anything but recoil on their own cause end_token in general, opinions contrary to those commonly received can only obtain a hearing by studied moderation of language, and the most cautious avoidance of unnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever deviate even in a slight degree without losing ground: while unmeasured vituperation employed on the side of the prevailing opinion, really does deter people from professing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who profess them end_token for the interest, therefore, of truth and justice, it is far more important to restrain this employment of vituperative language than the other; and, for example, if it were necessary to choose, there would be much more need to discourage offensive attacks on infidelity, than on religion end_token it is, however, obvious that law and authority have no business with restraining either, while opinion ought, in every instance, to determine its verdict by the circumstances of the individual case; condemning every one, on whichever side of the argument he places himself, in whose mode of advocacy either want of candour, or malignity, bigotry, or intolerance of feeling manifest themselves; but not inferring these vices from the side which a person takes, though it be the contrary side of the question to our own: and giving merited honour to every one, whatever opinion he may hold, who has calmness to see and honesty to state what his opponents and their opinions really are, exaggerating nothing to their discredit, keeping nothing back which tells, or can be supposed to tell, in their favour end_token this is the real morality of public discussion; and if often violated, i am happy to think that there are many controversialists who to a great extent observe it, and a still greater number who conscientiously strive towards it end_token these words had scarcely been written, when, as if to give them an emphatic contradiction, occurred the government press prosecutions of 1858 end_token that ill-judged interference with the liberty of public discussion has not, however, induced me to alter a single word in the text, nor has it at all weakened my conviction that, moments of panic excepted, the era of pains and penalties for political discussion has, in our own country, passed away end_token for, in the first place, the prosecutions were not persisted in; and, in the second, they were never, properly speaking, political prosecutions end_token the offence charged was not that of criticising institutions, or the acts or persons of rulers, but of circulating what was deemed an immoral doctrine, the lawfulness of tyrannicide end_token if the arguments of the present chapter are of any validity, there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered end_token it would, therefore, be irrelevant and out of place to examine here, whether the doctrine of tyrannicide deserves that title end_token i shall content myself with saying, that the subject has been at all times one of the open questions of morals; that the act of a private citizen in striking down a criminal, who, by raising himself above the law, has placed himself beyond the reach of legal punishment or control, has been accounted by whole nations, and by some of the best and wisest of men, not a crime, but an act of exalted virtue; and that, right or wrong, it is not of the nature of assassination, but of civil war end_token as such, i hold that the instigation to it, in a specific case, may be a proper subject of punishment, but only if an overt act has followed, and at least a probable connection can be established between the act and the instigation end_token even then, it is not a foreign government, but the very government assailed, which alone, in the exercise of self-defence, can legitimately punish attacks directed against its own existence end_token thomas pooley, bodmin assizes, july 31, 1857 end_token in december following, he received a free pardon from the crown end_token george jacob holyoake, august 17, 1857; edward truelove, july, 1857 end_token baron de gleichen, marlborough-street police court, august 4, 1857 end_token ample warning may be drawn from the large infusion of the passions of a persecutor, which mingled with the general display of the worst parts of our national character on the occasion of the sepoy insurrection end_token the ravings of fanatics or charlatans from the pulpit may be unworthy of notice; but the heads of the evangelical party have announced as their principle, for the government of hindoos and mahomedans, that no schools be supported by public money in which the bible is not taught, and by necessary consequence that no public employment be given to any but real or pretended christians end_token an under-secretary of state, in a speech delivered to his constituents on the 12th of november, 1857, is reported to have said: \"toleration of their faith\" (the faith of a hundred millions of british subjects), \"the superstition which they called religion, by the british government, had had the effect of retarding the ascendency of the british name, and preventing the salutary growth of christianity end_token end_token end_token end_token toleration was the great corner-stone of the religious liberties of this country; but do not let them abuse that precious word toleration end_token as he understood it, it meant the complete liberty to all, freedom of worship, _among christians, who worshipped upon the same foundation_ end_token it meant toleration of all sects and denominations of _christians who believed in the one mediation_ end_token\" i desire to call attention to the fact, that a man who has been deemed fit to fill a high office in the government of this country, under a liberal ministry, maintains the doctrine that all who do not believe in the divinity of christ are beyond the pale of toleration end_token who, after this imbecile display, can indulge the illusion that religious persecution has passed away, never to return? of individuality, as one of the elements of well-being end_token such being the reasons which make it imperative that human beings should be free to form opinions, and to express their opinions without reserve; and such the baneful consequences to the intellectual, and through that to the moral nature of man, unless this liberty is either conceded, or asserted in spite of prohibition; let us next examine whether the same reasons do not require that men should be free to act upon their opinions to carry these out in their lives, without hindrance, either physical or moral, from their fellow-men, so long as it is at their own risk and peril end_token this last proviso is of course indispensable end_token no one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions end_token on the contrary, even opinions lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act end_token an opinion that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard end_token acts, of whatever kind, which, without justifiable cause, do harm to others, may be, and in the more important cases absolutely require to be, controlled by the unfavourable sentiments, and, when needful, by the active interference of mankind end_token the liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people end_token but if he refrains from molesting others in what concerns them, and merely acts according to his own inclination and judgment in things which concern himself, the same reasons which show that opinion should be free, prove also that he should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions into practice at his own cost end_token that mankind are not infallible; that their truths, for the most part, are only half-truths; that unity of opinion, unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite opinions, is not desirable, and diversity not an evil, but a good, until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognising all sides of the truth, are principles applicable to men's modes of action, not less than to their opinions end_token as it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different opinions, so is it that there should be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one thinks fit to try them end_token it is desirable, in short, that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself end_token where, not the person's own character, but the traditions or customs of other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress end_token in maintaining this principle, the greatest difficulty to be encountered does not lie in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledged end, but in the indifference of persons in general to the end itself end_token if it were felt that the free development of individuality is one of the leading essentials of well-being; that it is not only a co-ordinate element with all that is designated by the terms civilisation, instruction, education, culture, but is itself a necessary part and condition of all those things; there would be no danger that liberty should be under-valued, and the adjustment of the boundaries between it and social control would present no extraordinary difficulty end_token but the evil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the common modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any regard on its own account end_token the majority, being satisfied with the ways of mankind as they now are (for it is they who make them what they are), cannot comprehend why those ways should not be good enough for everybody; and what is more, spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of the majority of moral and social reformers, but is rather looked on with jealousy, as a troublesome and perhaps rebellious obstruction to the general acceptance of what these reformers, in their own judgment, think would be best for mankind end_token few persons, out of germany, even comprehend the meaning of the doctrine which wilhelm von humboldt, so eminent both as a savant and as a politician, made the text of a treatise that \"the end of man, or that which is prescribed by the eternal or immutable dictates of reason, and not suggested by vague and transient desires, is the highest and most harmonious development of his powers to a complete and consistent whole;\" that, therefore, the object \"towards which every human being must ceaselessly direct his efforts, and on which especially those who design to influence their fellow-men must ever keep their eyes, is the individuality of power and development;\" that for this there are two requisites, \"freedom, and a variety of situations;\" and that from the union of these arise \"individual vigour and manifold diversity,\" which combine themselves in \"originality end_token\" little, however, as people are accustomed to a doctrine like that of von humboldt, and surprising as it may be to them to find so high a value attached to individuality, the question, one must nevertheless think, can only be one of degree end_token no one's idea of excellence in conduct is that people should do absolutely nothing but copy one another end_token no one would assert that people ought not to put into their mode of life, and into the conduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their own judgment, or of their own individual character end_token on the other hand, it would be absurd to pretend that people ought to live as if nothing whatever had been known in the world before they came into it; as if experience had as yet done nothing towards showing that one mode of existence, or of conduct, is preferable to another end_token nobody denies that people should be so taught and trained in youth, as to know and benefit by the ascertained results of human experience end_token but it is the privilege and proper condition of a human being, arrived at the maturity of his faculties, to use and interpret experience in his own way end_token it is for him to find out what part of recorded experience is properly applicable to his own circumstances and character end_token the traditions and customs of other people are, to a certain extent, evidence of what their experience has taught _them_; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his deference: but, in the first place, their experience may be too narrow; or they may not have interpreted it rightly end_token secondly, their interpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuitable to him end_token customs are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters: and his circumstances or his character may be uncustomary end_token thirdly, though the customs be both good as customs, and suitable to him, yet to conform to custom, merely as custom, does not educate or develop in him any of the qualities which are the distinctive endowment of a human being end_token the human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity, and even moral preference, are exercised only in making a choice end_token he who does anything because it is the custom, makes no choice end_token he gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring what is best end_token the mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used end_token the faculties are called into no exercise by doing a thing merely because others do it, no more than by believing a thing only because others believe it end_token if the grounds of an opinion are not conclusive to the person's own reason, his reason cannot be strengthened, but is likely to be weakened by his adopting it: and if the inducements to an act are not such as are consentaneous to his own feelings and character (where affection, or the rights of others, are not concerned), it is so much done towards rendering his feelings and character inert and torpid, instead of active and energetic end_token he who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation end_token he who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his faculties end_token he must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to foresee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to his deliberate decision end_token and these qualities he requires and exercises exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one end_token it is possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of harm's way, without any of these things end_token but what will be his comparative worth as a human being? it really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it end_token among the works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself end_token supposing it were possible to get houses built, corn grown, battles fought, causes tried, and even churches erected and prayers said, by machinery by automatons in human form it would be a considerable loss to exchange for these automatons even the men and women who at present inhabit the more civilised parts of the world, and who assuredly are but starved specimens of what nature can and will produce end_token human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing end_token it will probably be conceded that it is desirable people should exercise their understandings, and that an intelligent following of custom, or even occasionally an intelligent deviation from custom, is better than a blind and simply mechanical adhesion to it end_token to a certain extent it is admitted, that our understanding should be our own: but there is not the same willingness to admit that our desires and impulses should be our own likewise; or that to possess impulses of our own, and of any strength, is anything but a peril and a snare end_token yet desires and impulses are as much a part of a perfect human being, as beliefs and restraints: and strong impulses are only perilous when not properly balanced; when one set of aims and inclinations is developed into strength, while others, which ought to co-exist with them, remain weak and inactive end_token it is not because men's desires are strong that they act ill; it is because their consciences are weak end_token there is no natural connection between strong impulses and a weak conscience end_token the natural connection is the other way end_token to say that one person's desires and feelings are stronger and more various than those of another, is merely to say that he has more of the raw material of human nature, and is therefore capable, perhaps of more evil, but certainly of more good end_token strong impulses are but another name for energy end_token energy may be turned to bad uses; but more good may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent and impassive one end_token those who have most natural feeling, are always those whose cultivated feelings may be made the strongest end_token the same strong susceptibilities which make the personal impulses vivid and powerful, are also the source from whence are generated the most passionate love of virtue, and the sternest self-control end_token it is through the cultivation of these, that society both does its duty and protects its interests: not by rejecting the stuff of which heroes are made, because it knows not how to make them end_token a person whose desires and impulses are his own are the expression of his own nature, as it has been developed and modified by his own culture is said to have a character end_token one whose desires and impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than a steam-engine has a character end_token if, in addition to being his own, his impulses are strong, and are under the government of a strong will, he has an energetic character end_token whoever thinks that individuality of desires and impulses should not be encouraged to unfold itself, must maintain that society has no need of strong natures is not the better for containing many persons who have much character and that a high general average of energy is not desirable end_token in some early states of society, these forces might be, and were, too much ahead of the power which society then possessed of disciplining and controlling them end_token there has been a time when the element of spontaneity and individuality was in excess, and the social principle had a hard struggle with it end_token the difficulty then was, to induce men of strong bodies or minds to pay obedience to any rules which required them to control their impulses end_token to overcome this difficulty, law and discipline, like the popes struggling against the emperors, asserted a power over the whole man, claiming to control all his life in order to control his character which society had not found any other sufficient means of binding end_token but society has now fairly got the better of individuality; and the danger which threatens human nature is not the excess, but the deficiency, of personal impulses and preferences end_token things are vastly changed, since the passions of those who were strong by station or by personal endowment were in a state of habitual rebellion against laws and ordinances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable the persons within their reach to enjoy any particle of security end_token in our times, from the highest class of society down to the lowest, every one lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship end_token not only in what concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, the individual, or the family, do not ask themselves what do i prefer? or, what would suit my character and disposition? or, what would allow the best and highest in me to have fair-play, and enable it to grow and thrive? they ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? what is usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or (worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station and circumstances superior to mine? i do not mean that they choose what is customary, in preference to what suits their own inclination end_token it does not occur to them to have any inclination, except for what is customary end_token thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what people do for pleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of; they live in crowds; they exercise choice only among things commonly done: peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes: until by dint of not following their own nature, they have no nature to follow: their human capacities are withered and starved: they become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their own end_token now is this, or is it not, the desirable condition of human nature? it is so, on the calvinistic theory end_token according to that, the one great offence of man is self-will end_token all the good of which humanity is capable, is comprised in obedience end_token you have no choice; thus you must do, and no otherwise: \"whatever is not a duty, is a sin end_token\" human nature being radically corrupt, there is no redemption for any one until human nature is killed within him end_token to one holding this theory of life, crushing out any of the human faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is no evil: man needs no capacity, but that of surrendering himself to the will of god: and if he uses any of his faculties for any other purpose but to do that supposed will more effectually, he is better without them end_token that is the theory of calvinism; and it is held, in a mitigated form, by many who do not consider themselves calvinists; the mitigation consisting in giving a less ascetic interpretation to the alleged will of god; asserting it to be his will that mankind should gratify some of their inclinations; of course not in the manner they themselves prefer, but in the way of obedience, that is, in a way prescribed to them by authority; and, therefore, by the necessary conditions of the case, the same for all end_token in some such insidious form there is at present a strong tendency to this narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type of human character which it patronises end_token many persons, no doubt, sincerely think that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their maker designed them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a much finer thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures of animals, than as nature made them end_token but if it be any part of religion to believe that man was made by a good being, it is more consistent with that faith to believe, that this being gave all human faculties that they might be cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and that he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to the ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of their capabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment end_token there is a different type of human excellence from the calvinistic; a conception of humanity as having its nature bestowed on it for other purposes than merely to be abnegated end_token \"pagan self-assertion\" is one of the elements of human worth, as well as \"christian self-denial end_token\"there is a greek ideal of self-development, which the platonic and christian ideal of self-government blends with, but does not supersede end_token it may be better to be a john knox than an alcibiades, but it is better to be a pericles than either; nor would a pericles, if we had one in these days, be without anything good which belonged to john knox end_token it is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the limits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works partake the character of those who do them, by the same process human life also becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing more abundant aliment to high thoughts and elevating feelings, and strengthening the tie which binds every individual to the race, by making the race infinitely better worth belonging to end_token in proportion to the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others end_token there is a greater fulness of life about his own existence, and when there is more life in the units there is more in the mass which is composed of them end_token as much compression as is necessary to prevent the stronger specimens of human nature from encroaching on the rights of others, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is ample compensation even in the point of view of human development end_token the means of development which the individual loses by being prevented from gratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly obtained at the expense of the development of other people end_token and even to himself there is a full equivalent in the better development of the social part of his nature, rendered possible by the restraint put upon the selfish part end_token to be held to rigid rules of justice for the sake of others, develops the feelings and capacities which have the good of others for their object end_token but to be restrained in things not affecting their good, by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable, except such force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint end_token if acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature end_token to give any fair-play to the nature of each, it is essential that different persons should be allowed to lead different lives end_token in proportion as this latitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to posterity end_token even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long as individuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professes to be enforcing the will of god or the injunctions of men end_token having said that individuality is the same thing with development, and that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings, i might here close the argument: for what more or better can be said of any condition of human affairs, than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing they can be? or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good, than that it prevents this? doubtless, however, these considerations will not suffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessary further to show, that these developed human beings are of some use to the undeveloped to point out to those who do not desire liberty, and would not avail themselves of it, that they may be in some intelligible manner rewarded for allowing other people to make use of it without hindrance end_token in the first place, then, i would suggest that they might possibly learn something from them end_token it will not be denied by anybody, that originality is a valuable element in human affairs end_token there is always need of persons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what were once truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, and set the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sense in human life end_token this cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does not believe that the world has already attained perfection in all its ways and practices end_token it is true that this benefit is not capable of being rendered by everybody alike: there are but few persons, in comparison with the whole of mankind, whose experiments, if adopted by others, would be likely to be any improvement on established practice end_token but these few are the salt of the earth; without them, human life would become a stagnant pool end_token not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already existed end_token if there were nothing new to be done, would human intellect cease to be necessary? would it be a reason why those who do the old things should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, not like human beings? there is only too great a tendency in the best beliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unless there were a succession of persons whose ever-recurring originality prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merely traditional, such dead matter would not resist the smallest shock from anything really alive, and there would be no reason why civilisation should not die out, as in the byzantine empire end_token persons of genius, it is true, are, and are always likely to be, a small minority; but in order to have them, it is necessary to preserve the soil in which they grow end_token genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom end_token persons of genius are, _ex vi termini_, more individual than any other people less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without hurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds which society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming their own character end_token if from timidity they consent to be forced into one of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannot expand under the pressure remain unexpanded, society will be little the better for their genius end_token if they are of a strong character, and break their fetters, they become a mark for the society which has not succeeded in reducing them to commonplace, to point at with solemn warning as \"wild,\" \"erratic,\" and the like; much as if one should complain of the niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks like a dutch canal end_token i insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and the necessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in thought and in practice, being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory, but knowing also that almost every one, in reality, is totally indifferent to it end_token people think genius a fine thing if it enables a man to write an exciting poem, or paint a picture end_token but in its true sense, that of originality in thought and action, though no one says that it is not a thing to be admired, nearly all, at heart, think that they can do very well without it end_token unhappily this is too natural to be wondered at end_token originality is the one thing which unoriginal minds cannot feel the use of end_token they cannot see what it is to do for them: how should they? if they could see what it would do for them, it would not be originality end_token the first service which originality has to render them, is that of opening their eyes: which being once fully done, they would have a chance of being themselves original end_token meanwhile, recollecting that nothing was ever yet done which some one was not the first to do, and that all good things which exist are the fruits of originality, let them be modest enough to believe that there is something still left for it to accomplish, and assure themselves that they are more in need of originality, the less they are conscious of the want end_token in sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real or supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among mankind end_token in ancient history, in the middle ages, and in a diminishing degree through the long transition from feudality to the present time, the individual was a power in himself; and if he had either great talents or a high social position, he was a considerable power end_token at present individuals are lost in the crowd end_token in politics it is almost a triviality to say that public opinion now rules the world end_token the only power deserving the name is that of masses, and of governments while they make themselves the organ of the tendencies and instincts of masses end_token this is as true in the moral and social relations of private life as in public transactions end_token those whose opinions go by the name of public opinion, are not always the same sort of public: in america they are the whole white population; in england, chiefly the middle class end_token but they are always a mass, that is to say, collective mediocrity end_token and what is a still greater novelty, the mass do not now take their opinions from dignitaries in church or state, from ostensible leaders, or from books end_token their thinking is done for them by men much like themselves, addressing them or speaking in their name, on the spur of the moment, through the newspapers end_token i am not complaining of all this end_token i do not assert that anything better is compatible, as a general rule, with the present low state of the human mind end_token but that does not hinder the government of mediocrity from being mediocre government end_token no government by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its political acts or in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it fosters, ever did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereign many have let themselves be guided (which in their best times they always have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly gifted and instructed one or few end_token the initiation of all wise or noble things, comes and must come from individuals; generally at first from some one individual end_token the honour and glory of the average man is that he is capable of following that initiative; that he can respond internally to wise and noble things, and be led to them with his eyes open end_token i am not countenancing the sort of \"hero-worship\" which applauds the strong man of genius for forcibly seizing on the government of the world and making it do his bidding in spite of itself end_token all he can claim is, freedom to point out the way end_token the power of compelling others into it, is not only inconsistent with the freedom and development of all the rest, but corrupting to the strong man himself end_token it does seem, however, that when the opinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become or becoming the dominant power, the counterpoise and corrective to that tendency would be, the more and more pronounced individuality of those who stand on the higher eminences of thought end_token it is in these circumstances most especially, that exceptional individuals, instead of being deterred, should be encouraged in acting differently from the mass end_token in other times there was no advantage in their doing so, unless they acted not only differently, but better end_token in this age the mere example of nonconformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom, is itself a service end_token precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as to make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break through that tyranny, that people should be eccentric end_token eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it contained end_token that so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of the time end_token i have said that it is important to give the freest scope possible to uncustomary things, in order that it may in time appear which of these are fit to be converted into customs end_token but independence of action, and disregard of custom are not solely deserving of encouragement for the chance they afford that better modes of action, and customs more worthy of general adoption, may be struck out; nor is it only persons of decided mental superiority who have a just claim to carry on their lives in their own way end_token there is no reason that all human existences should be constructed on some one, or some small number of patterns end_token if a person possesses any tolerable amount of common-sense and experience, his own mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the best in itself, but because it is his own mode end_token human beings are not like sheep; and even sheep are not undistinguishably alike end_token a man cannot get a coat or a pair of boots to fit him, unless they are either made to his measure, or he has a whole warehouseful to choose from: and is it easier to fit him with a life than with a coat, or are human beings more like one another in their whole physical and spiritual conformation than in the shape of their feet? if it were only that people have diversities of taste, that is reason enough for not attempting to shape them all after one model end_token but different persons also require different conditions for their spiritual development; and can no more exist healthily in the same moral, than all the variety of plants can in the same physical, atmosphere and climate end_token the same things which are helps to one person towards the cultivation of his higher nature, are hindrances to another end_token the same mode of life is a healthy excitement to one, keeping all his faculties of action and enjoyment in their best order, while to another it is a distracting burthen, which suspends or crushes all internal life end_token such are the differences among human beings in their sources of pleasure, their susceptibilities of pain, and the operation on them of different physical and moral agencies, that unless there is a corresponding diversity in their modes of life, they neither obtain their fair share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, and aesthetic stature of which their nature is capable end_token why then should tolerance, as far as the public sentiment is concerned, extend only to tastes and modes of life which extort acquiescence by the multitude of their adherents? nowhere (except in some monastic institutions) is diversity of taste entirely unrecognised; a person may, without blame, either like or dislike rowing, or smoking, or music, or athletic exercises, or chess, or cards, or study, because both those who like each of these things, and those who dislike them, are too numerous to be put down end_token but the man, and still more the woman, who can be accused either of doing \"what nobody does,\" or of not doing \"what everybody does,\" is the subject of as much depreciatory remark as if he or she had committed some grave moral delinquency end_token persons require to possess a title, or some other badge of rank, or of the consideration of people of rank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxury of doing as they like without detriment to their estimation end_token to indulge somewhat, i repeat: for whoever allow themselves much of that indulgence, incur the risk of something worse than disparaging speeches they are in peril of a commission _de lunatico_, and of having their property taken from them and given to their relations end_token there is one characteristic of the present direction of public opinion, peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstration of individuality end_token the general average of mankind are not only moderate in intellect, but also moderate in inclinations: they have no tastes or wishes strong enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and they consequently do not understand those who have, and class all such with the wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon end_token now, in addition to this fact which is general, we have only to suppose that a strong movement has set in towards the improvement of morals, and it is evident what we have to expect end_token in these days such a movement has set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increased regularity of conduct, and discouragement of excesses; and there is a philanthropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no more inviting field than the moral and prudential improvement of our fellow-creatures end_token these tendencies of the times cause the public to be more disposed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules of conduct, and endeavour to make every one conform to the approved standard end_token and that standard, express or tacit, is to desire nothing strongly end_token its ideal of character is to be without any marked character; to maim by compression, like a chinese lady's foot, every part of human nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make the person markedly dissimilar in outline to commonplace humanity end_token as is usually the case with ideals which exclude one-half of what is desirable, the present standard of approbation produces only an inferior imitation of the other half end_token instead of great energies guided by vigorous reason, and strong feelings strongly controlled by a conscientious will, its result is weak feelings and weak energies, which therefore can be kept in outward conformity to rule without any strength either of will or of reason end_token already energetic characters on any large scale are becoming merely traditional end_token there is now scarcely any outlet for energy in this country except business end_token the energy expended in that may still be regarded as considerable end_token what little is left from that employment, is expended on some hobby; which may be a useful, even a philanthropic hobby, but is always some one thing, and generally a thing of small dimensions end_token the greatness of england is now all collective: individually small, we only appear capable of anything great by our habit of combining; and with this our moral and religious philanthropists are perfectly contented end_token but it was men of another stamp than this that made england what it has been; and men of another stamp will be needed to prevent its decline end_token the despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human advancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim at something better than customary, which is called, according to circumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress or improvement end_token the spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of liberty, for it may aim at forcing improvements on an unwilling people; and the spirit of liberty, in so far as it resists such attempts, may ally itself locally and temporarily with the opponents of improvement; but the only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is liberty, since by it there are as many possible independent centres of improvement as there are individuals end_token the progressive principle, however, in either shape, whether as the love of liberty or of improvement, is antagonistic to the sway of custom, involving at least emancipation from that yoke; and the contest between the two constitutes the chief interest of the history of mankind end_token the greater part of the world has, properly speaking, no history, because the despotism of custom is complete end_token this is the case over the whole east end_token custom is there, in all things, the final appeal; justice and right mean conformity to custom; the argument of custom no one, unless some tyrant intoxicated with power, thinks of resisting end_token and we see the result end_token those nations must once have had originality; they did not start out of the ground populous, lettered, and versed in many of the arts of life; they made themselves all this, and were then the greatest and most powerful nations in the world end_token what are they now? the subjects or dependants of tribes whose forefathers wandered in the forests when theirs had magnificent palaces and gorgeous temples, but over whom custom exercised only a divided rule with liberty and progress end_token a people, it appears, may be progressive for a certain length of time, and then stop: when does it stop? when it ceases to possess individuality end_token if a similar change should befall the nations of europe, it will not be in exactly the same shape: the despotism of custom with which these nations are threatened is not precisely stationariness end_token it proscribes singularity, but it does not preclude change, provided all change together end_token we have discarded the fixed costumes of our forefathers; every one must still dress like other people, but the fashion may change once or twice a year end_token we thus take care that when there is change, it shall be for change's sake, and not from any idea of beauty or convenience; for the same idea of beauty or convenience would not strike all the world at the same moment, and be simultaneously thrown aside by all at another moment end_token but we are progressive as well as changeable: we continually make new inventions in mechanical things, and keep them until they are again superseded by better; we are eager for improvement in politics, in education, even in morals, though in this last our idea of improvement chiefly consists in persuading or forcing other people to be as good as ourselves end_token it is not progress that we object to; on the contrary, we flatter ourselves that we are the most progressive people who ever lived end_token it is individuality that we war against: we should think we had done wonders if we had made ourselves all alike; forgetting that the unlikeness of one person to another is generally the first thing which draws the attention of either to the imperfection of his own type, and the superiority of another, or the possibility, by combining the advantages of both, of producing something better than either end_token we have a warning example in china a nation of much talent, and, in some respects, even wisdom, owing to the rare good fortune of having been provided at an early period with a particularly good set of customs, the work, in some measure, of men to whom even the most enlightened european must accord, under certain limitations, the title of sages and philosophers end_token they are remarkable, too, in the excellence of their apparatus for impressing, as far as possible, the best wisdom they possess upon every mind in the community, and securing that those who have appropriated most of it shall occupy the posts of honour and power end_token surely the people who did this have discovered the secret of human progressiveness, and must have kept themselves steadily at the head of the movement of the world end_token on the contrary, they have become stationary have remained so for thousands of years; and if they are ever to be farther improved, it must be by foreigners end_token they have succeeded beyond all hope in what english philanthropists are so industriously working at in making a people all alike, all governing their thoughts and conduct by the same maxims and rules; and these are the fruits end_token the modern rã©gime of public opinion is, in an unorganised form, what the chinese educational and political systems are in an organised; and unless individuality shall be able successfully to assert itself against this yoke, europe, notwithstanding its noble antecedents and its professed christianity, will tend to become another china end_token what is it that has hitherto preserved europe from this lot? what has made the european family of nations an improving, instead of a stationary portion of mankind? not any superior excellence in them, which, when it exists, exists as the effect, not as the cause; but their remarkable diversity of character and culture end_token individuals, classes, nations, have been extremely unlike one another: they have struck out a great variety of paths, each leading to something valuable; and although at every period those who travelled in different paths have been intolerant of one another, and each would have thought it an excellent thing if all the rest could have been compelled to travel his road, their attempts to thwart each other's development have rarely had any permanent success, and each has in time endured to receive the good which the others have offered end_token europe is, in my judgment, wholly indebted to this plurality of paths for its progressive and many-sided development end_token but it already begins to possess this benefit in a considerably less degree end_token it is decidedly advancing towards the chinese ideal of making all people alike end_token m end_token de tocqueville, in his last important work, remarks how much more the frenchmen of the present day resemble one another, than did those even of the last generation end_token the same remark might be made of englishmen in a far greater degree end_token in a passage already quoted from wilhelm von humboldt, he points out two things as necessary conditions of human development, because necessary to render people unlike one another; namely, freedom, and variety of situations end_token the second of these two conditions is in this country every day diminishing end_token the circumstances which surround different classes and individuals, and shape their characters, are daily becoming more assimilated end_token formerly, different ranks, different neighbourhoods, different trades and professions, lived in what might be called different worlds; at present, to a great degree in the same end_token comparatively speaking, they now read the same things, listen to the same things, see the same things, go to the same places, have their hopes and fears directed to the same objects, have the same rights and liberties, and the same means of asserting them end_token great as are the differences of position which remain, they are nothing to those which have ceased end_token and the assimilation is still proceeding end_token all the political changes of the age promote it, since they all tend to raise the low and to lower the high end_token every extension of education promotes it, because education brings people under common influences, and gives them access to the general stock of facts and sentiments end_token improvements in the means of communication promote it, by bringing the inhabitants of distant places into personal contact, and keeping up a rapid flow of changes of residence between one place and another end_token the increase of commerce and manufactures promotes it, by diffusing more widely the advantages of easy circumstances, and opening all objects of ambition, even the highest, to general competition, whereby the desire of rising becomes no longer the character of a particular class, but of all classes end_token a more powerful agency than even all these, in bringing about a general similarity among mankind, is the complete establishment, in this and other free countries, of the ascendency of public opinion in the state end_token as the various social eminences which enabled persons entrenched on them to disregard the opinion of the multitude, gradually become levelled; as the very idea of resisting the will of the public, when it is positively known that they have a will, disappears more and more from the minds of practical politicians; there ceases to be any social support for non-conformity any substantive power in society, which, itself opposed to the ascendency of numbers, is interested in taking under its protection opinions and tendencies at variance with those of the public end_token the combination of all these causes forms so great a mass of influences hostile to individuality, that it is not easy to see how it can stand its ground end_token it will do so with increasing difficulty, unless the intelligent part of the public can be made to feel its value to see that it is good there should be differences, even though not for the better, even though, as it may appear to them, some should be for the worse end_token if the claims of individuality are ever to be asserted, the time is now, while much is still wanting to complete the enforced assimilation end_token it is only in the earlier stages that any stand can be successfully made against the encroachment end_token the demand that all other people shall resemble ourselves, grows by what it feeds on end_token if resistance waits till life is reduced nearly to one uniform type, all deviations from that type will come to be considered impious, immoral, even monstrous and contrary to nature end_token mankind speedily become unable to conceive diversity, when they have been for some time unaccustomed to see it end_token from the german of baron wilhelm von humboldt, pp end_token 11-13 end_token there is something both contemptible and frightful in the sort of evidence on which, of late years, any person can be judicially declared unfit for the management of his affairs; and after his death, his disposal of his property can be set aside, if there is enough of it to pay the expenses of litigation which are charged on the property itself end_token all the minute details of his daily life are pried into, and whatever is found which, seen through the medium of the perceiving and describing faculties of the lowest of the low, bears an appearance unlike absolute commonplace, is laid before the jury as evidence of insanity, and often with success; the jurors being little, if at all, less vulgar and ignorant than the witnesses; while the judges, with that extraordinary want of knowledge of human nature and life which continually astonishes us in english lawyers, often help to mislead them end_token these trials speak volumes as to the state of feeling and opinion among the vulgar with regard to human liberty end_token so far from setting any value on individuality so far from respecting the rights of each individual to act, in things indifferent, as seems good to his own judgment and inclinations, judges and juries cannot even conceive that a person in a state of sanity can desire such freedom end_token in former days, when it was proposed to burn atheists, charitable people used to suggest putting them in a madhouse instead: it would be nothing surprising nowadays were we to see this done, and the doers applauding themselves, because, instead of persecuting for religion, they had adopted so humane and christian a mode of treating these unfortunates, not without a silent satisfaction at their having thereby obtained their deserts end_token of the limits to the authority of society over the individual end_token what, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual over himself? where does the authority of society begin? how much of human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society? each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more particularly concerns it end_token to individuality should belong the part of life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to society, the part which chiefly interests society end_token though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest end_token this conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation end_token these conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment end_token nor is this all that society may do end_token the acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights end_token the offender may then be justly punished by opinion though not by law end_token as soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion end_token but there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and the ordinary amount of understanding) end_token in all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences end_token it would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine, to suppose that it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beings have no business with each other's conduct in life, and that they should not concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another, unless their own interest is involved end_token instead of any diminution, there is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the good of others end_token but disinterested benevolence can find other instruments to persuade people to their good, than whips and scourges, either of the literal or the metaphorical sort end_token i am the last person to undervalue the self-regarding virtues; they are only second in importance, if even second, to the social end_token it is equally the business of education to cultivate both end_token but even education works by conviction and persuasion as well as by compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the period of education is past, the self-regarding virtues should be inculcated end_token human beings owe to each other help to distinguish the better from the worse, and encouragement to choose the former and avoid the latter end_token they should be for ever stimulating each other to increased exercise of their higher faculties, and increased direction of their feelings and aims towards wise instead of foolish, elevating instead of degrading, objects and contemplations end_token but neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it end_token he is the person most interested in his own well-being: the interest which any other person, except in cases of strong personal attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has; the interest which society has in him individually (except as to his conduct to others) is fractional, and altogether indirect: while, with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else end_token the interference of society to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards himself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases, by persons no better acquainted with the circumstances of such cases than those are who look at them merely from without end_token in this department, therefore, of human affairs, individuality has its proper field of action end_token in the conduct of human beings towards one another, it is necessary that general rules should for the most part be observed, in order that people may know what they have to expect; but in each person's own concerns, his individual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise end_token considerations to aid his judgment, exhortations to strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded on him, by others; but he himself is the final judge end_token all errors which he is likely to commit against advice and warning, are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good end_token i do not mean that the feelings with which a person is regarded by others, ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding qualities or deficiencies end_token this is neither possible nor desirable end_token if he is eminent in any of the qualities which conduce to his own good, he is, so far, a proper object of admiration end_token he is so much the nearer to the ideal perfection of human nature end_token if he is grossly deficient in those qualities, a sentiment the opposite of admiration will follow end_token there is a degree of folly, and a degree of what may be called (though the phrase is not unobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which, though it cannot justify doing harm to the person who manifests it, renders him necessarily and properly a subject of distaste, or, in extreme cases, even of contempt: a person could not have the opposite qualities in due strength without entertaining these feelings end_token though doing no wrong to any one, a person may so act as to compel us to judge him, and feel to him, as a fool, or as a being of an inferior order: and since this judgment and feeling are a fact which he would prefer to avoid, it is doing him a service to warn him of it beforehand, as of any other disagreeable consequence to which he exposes himself end_token it would be well, indeed, if this good office were much more freely rendered than the common notions of politeness at present permit, and if one person could honestly point out to another that he thinks him in fault, without being considered unmannerly or presuming end_token we have a right, also, in various ways, to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours end_token we are not bound, for example, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it (though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the society most acceptable to us end_token we have a right, and it may be our duty, to caution others against him, if we think his example or conversation likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates end_token we may give others a preference over him in optional good offices, except those which tend to his improvement end_token in these various modes a person may suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults which directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so far as they are the natural, and, as it were, the spontaneous consequences of the faults themselves, not because they are purposely inflicted on him for the sake of punishment end_token a person who shows rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit who cannot live within moderate means who cannot restrain himself from hurtful indulgences who pursues animal pleasures at the expense of those of feeling and intellect must expect to be lowered in the opinion of others, and to have a less share of their favourable sentiments; but of this he has no right to complain, unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his social relations, and has thus established a title to their good offices, which is not affected by his demerits towards himself end_token what i contend for is, that the inconveniences which are strictly inseparable from the unfavourable judgment of others, are the only ones to which a person should ever be subjected for that portion of his conduct and character which concerns his own good, but which does not affect the interests of others in their relations with him end_token acts injurious to others require a totally different treatment end_token encroachment on their rights; infliction on them of any loss or damage not justified by his own rights; falsehood or duplicity in dealing with them; unfair or ungenerous use of advantages over them; even selfish abstinence from defending them against injury these are fit objects of moral reprobation, and, in grave cases, of moral retribution and punishment end_token and not only these acts, but the dispositions which lead to them, are properly immoral, and fit subjects of disapprobation which may rise to abhorrence end_token cruelty of disposition; malice and ill-nature; that most anti-social and odious of all passions, envy; dissimulation and insincerity; irascibility on insufficient cause, and resentment disproportioned to the provocation; the love of domineering over others; the desire to engross more than one's share of advantages (the of the greeks); the pride which derives gratification from the abasement of others; the egotism which thinks self and its concerns more important than everything else, and decides all doubtful questions in its own favour; these are moral vices, and constitute a bad and odious moral character: unlike the self-regarding faults previously mentioned, which are not properly immoralities, and to whatever pitch they may be carried, do not constitute wickedness end_token they may be proofs of any amount of folly, or want of personal dignity and self-respect; but they are only a subject of moral reprobation when they involve a breach of duty to others, for whose sake the individual is bound to have care for himself end_token what are called duties to ourselves are not socially obligatory, unless circumstances render them at the same time duties to others end_token the term duty to oneself, when it means anything more than prudence, means self-respect or self-development; and for none of these is any one accountable to his fellow-creatures, because for none of them is it for the good of mankind that he be held accountable to them end_token the distinction between the loss of consideration which a person may rightly incur by defect of prudence or of personal dignity, and the reprobation which is due to him for an offence against the rights of others, is not a merely nominal distinction end_token it makes a vast difference both in our feelings and in our conduct towards him, whether he displeases us in things in which we think we have a right to control him, or in things in which we know that we have not end_token if he displeases us, we may express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a person as well as from a thing that displeases us; but we shall not therefore feel called on to make his life uncomfortable end_token we shall reflect that he already bears, or will bear, the whole penalty of his error; if he spoils his life by mismanagement, we shall not, for that reason, desire to spoil it still further: instead of wishing to punish him, we shall rather endeavour to alleviate his punishment, by showing him how he may avoid or cure the evils his conduct tends to bring upon him end_token he may be to us an object of pity, perhaps of dislike, but not of anger or resentment; we shall not treat him like an enemy of society: the worst we shall think ourselves justified in doing is leaving him to himself, if we do not interfere benevolently by showing interest or concern for him end_token it is far otherwise if he has infringed the rules necessary for the protection of his fellow-creatures, individually or collectively end_token the evil consequences of his acts do not then fall on himself, but on others; and society, as the protector of all its members, must retaliate on him; must inflict pain on him for the express purpose of punishment, and must take care that it be sufficiently severe end_token in the one case, he is an offender at our bar, and we are called on not only to sit in judgment on him, but, in one shape or another, to execute our own sentence: in the other case, it is not our part to inflict any suffering on him, except what may incidentally follow from our using the same liberty in the regulation of our own affairs, which we allow to him in his end_token the distinction here pointed out between the part of a person's life which concerns only himself, and that which concerns others, many persons will refuse to admit end_token how (it may be asked) can any part of the conduct of a member of society be a matter of indifference to the other members? no person is an entirely isolated being; it is impossible for a person to do anything seriously or permanently hurtful to himself, without mischief reaching at least to his near connections, and often far beyond them end_token if he injures his property, he does harm to those who directly or indirectly derived support from it, and usually diminishes, by a greater or less amount, the general resources of the community end_token if he deteriorates his bodily or mental faculties, he not only brings evil upon all who depended on him for any portion of their happiness, but disqualifies himself for rendering the services which he owes to his fellow-creatures generally; perhaps becomes a burthen on their affection or benevolence; and if such conduct were very frequent, hardly any offence that is committed would detract more from the general sum of good end_token finally, if by his vices or follies a person does no direct harm to others, he is nevertheless (it may be said) injurious by his example; and ought to be compelled to control himself, for the sake of those whom the sight or knowledge of his conduct might corrupt or mislead end_token and even (it will be added) if the consequences of misconduct could be confined to the vicious or thoughtless individual, ought society to abandon to their own guidance those who are manifestly unfit for it? if protection against themselves is confessedly due to children and persons under age, is not society equally bound to afford it to persons of mature years who are equally incapable of self-government? if gambling, or drunkenness, or incontinence, or idleness, or uncleanliness, are as injurious to happiness, and as great a hindrance to improvement, as many or most of the acts prohibited by law, why (it may be asked) should not law, so far as is consistent with practicability and social convenience, endeavour to repress these also? and as a supplement to the unavoidable imperfections of law, ought not opinion at least to organise a powerful police against these vices, and visit rigidly with social penalties those who are known to practise them? there is no question here (it may be said) about restricting individuality, or impeding the trial of new and original experiments in living end_token the only things it is sought to prevent are things which have been tried and condemned from the beginning of the world until now; things which experience has shown not to be useful or suitable to any person's individuality end_token there must be some length of time and amount of experience, after which a moral or prudential truth may be regarded as established: and it is merely desired to prevent generation after generation from falling over the same precipice which has been fatal to their predecessors end_token i fully admit that the mischief which a person does to himself, may seriously affect, both through their sympathies and their interests, those nearly connected with him, and in a minor degree, society at large end_token when, by conduct of this sort, a person is led to violate a distinct and assignable obligation to any other person or persons, the case is taken out of the self-regarding class, and becomes amenable to moral disapprobation in the proper sense of the term end_token if, for example, a man, through intemperance or extravagance, becomes unable to pay his debts, or, having undertaken the moral responsibility of a family, becomes from the same cause incapable of supporting or educating them, he is deservedly reprobated, and might be justly punished; but it is for the breach of duty to his family or creditors, not for the extravagance end_token if the resources which ought to have been devoted to them, had been diverted from them for the most prudent investment, the moral culpability would have been the same end_token george barnwell murdered his uncle to get money for his mistress, but if he had done it to set himself up in business, he would equally have been hanged end_token again, in the frequent case of a man who causes grief to his family by addiction to bad habits, he deserves reproach for his unkindness or ingratitude; but so he may for cultivating habits not in themselves vicious, if they are painful to those with whom he passes his life, or who from personal ties are dependent on him for their comfort end_token whoever fails in the consideration generally due to the interests and feelings of others, not being compelled by some more imperative duty, or justified by allowable self-preference, is a subject of moral disapprobation for that failure, but not for the cause of it, nor for the errors, merely personal to himself, which may have remotely led to it end_token in like manner, when a person disables himself, by conduct purely self-regarding, from the performance of some definite duty incumbent on him to the public, he is guilty of a social offence end_token no person ought to be punished simply for being drunk; but a soldier or a policeman should be punished for being drunk on duty end_token whenever, in short, there is a definite damage, or a definite risk of damage, either to an individual or to the public, the case is taken out of the province of liberty, and placed in that of morality or law end_token but with regard to the merely contingent, or, as it may be called, constructive injury which a person causes to society, by conduct which neither violates any specific duty to the public, nor occasions perceptible hurt to any assignable individual except himself; the inconvenience is one which society can afford to bear, for the sake of the greater good of human freedom end_token if grown persons are to be punished for not taking proper care of themselves, i would rather it were for their own sake, than under pretence of preventing them from impairing their capacity of rendering to society benefits which society does not pretend it has a right to exact end_token but i cannot consent to argue the point as if society had no means of bringing its weaker members up to its ordinary standard of rational conduct, except waiting till they do something irrational, and then punishing them, legally or morally, for it end_token society has had absolute power over them during all the early portion of their existence: it has had the whole period of childhood and nonage in which to try whether it could make them capable of rational conduct in life end_token the existing generation is master both of the training and the entire circumstances of the generation to come; it cannot indeed make them perfectly wise and good, because it is itself so lamentably deficient in goodness and wisdom; and its best efforts are not always, in individual cases, its most successful ones; but it is perfectly well able to make the rising generation, as a whole, as good as, and a little better than, itself end_token if society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the consequences end_token armed not only with all the powers of education, but with the ascendency which the authority of a received opinion always exercises over the minds who are least fitted to judge for themselves; and aided by the natural penalties which cannot be prevented from falling on those who incur the distaste or the contempt of those who know them; let not society pretend that it needs, besides all this, the power to issue commands and enforce obedience in the personal concerns of individuals, in which, on all principles of justice and policy, the decision ought to rest with those who are to abide the consequences end_token nor is there anything which tends more to discredit and frustrate the better means of influencing conduct, than a resort to the worse end_token if there be among those whom it is attempted to coerce into prudence or temperance, any of the material of which vigorous and independent characters are made, they will infallibly rebel against the yoke end_token no such person will ever feel that others have a right to control him in his concerns, such as they have to prevent him from injuring them in theirs; and it easily comes to be considered a mark of spirit and courage to fly in the face of such usurped authority, and do with ostentation the exact opposite of what it enjoins; as in the fashion of grossness which succeeded, in the time of charles ii end_token, to the fanatical moral intolerance of the puritans end_token with respect to what is said of the necessity of protecting society from the bad example set to others by the vicious or the self-indulgent; it is true that bad example may have a pernicious effect, especially the example of doing wrong to others with impunity to the wrong-doer end_token but we are now speaking of conduct which, while it does no wrong to others, is supposed to do great harm to the agent himself: and i do not see how those who believe this, can think otherwise than that the example, on the whole, must be more salutary than hurtful, since, if it displays the misconduct, it displays also the painful or degrading consequences which, if the conduct is justly censured, must be supposed to be in all or most cases attendant on it end_token but the strongest of all the arguments against the interference of the public with purely personal conduct, is that when it does interfere, the odds are that it interferes wrongly, and in the wrong place end_token on questions of social morality, of duty to others, the opinion of the public, that is, of an overruling majority, though often wrong, is likely to be still oftener right; because on such questions they are only required to judge of their own interests; of the manner in which some mode of conduct, if allowed to be practised, would affect themselves end_token but the opinion of a similar majority, imposed as a law on the minority, on questions of self-regarding conduct, is quite as likely to be wrong as right; for in these cases public opinion means, at the best, some people's opinion of what is good or bad for other people; while very often it does not even mean that; the public, with the most perfect indifference, passing over the pleasure or convenience of those whose conduct they censure, and considering only their own preference end_token there are many who consider as an injury to themselves any conduct which they have a distaste for, and resent it as an outrage to their feelings; as a religious bigot, when charged with disregarding the religious feelings of others, has been known to retort that they disregard his feelings, by persisting in their abominable worship or creed end_token but there is no parity between the feeling of a person for his own opinion, and the feeling of another who is offended at his holding it; no more than between the desire of a thief to take a purse, and the desire of the right owner to keep it end_token and a person's taste is as much his own peculiar concern as his opinion or his purse end_token it is easy for any one to imagine an ideal public, which leaves the freedom and choice of individuals in all uncertain matters undisturbed, and only requires them to abstain from modes of conduct which universal experience has condemned end_token but where has there been seen a public which set any such limit to its censorship? or when does the public trouble itself about universal experience? in its interferences with personal conduct it is seldom thinking of anything but the enormity of acting or feeling differently from itself; and this standard of judgment, thinly disguised, is held up to mankind as the dictate of religion and philosophy, by nine-tenths of all moralists and speculative writers end_token these teach that things are right because they are right; because we feel them to be so end_token they tell us to search in our own minds and hearts for laws of conduct binding on ourselves and on all others end_token what can the poor public do but apply these instructions, and make their own personal feelings of good and evil, if they are tolerably unanimous in them, obligatory on all the world? the evil here pointed out is not one which exists only in theory; and it may perhaps be expected that i should specify the instances in which the public of this age and country improperly invests its own preferences with the character of moral laws end_token i am not writing an essay on the aberrations of existing moral feeling end_token that is too weighty a subject to be discussed parenthetically, and by way of illustration end_token yet examples are necessary, to show that the principle i maintain is of serious and practical moment, and that i am not endeavouring to erect a barrier against imaginary evils end_token and it is not difficult to show, by abundant instances, that to extend the bounds of what may be called moral police, until it encroaches on the most unquestionably legitimate liberty of the individual, is one of the most universal of all human propensities end_token as a first instance, consider the antipathies which men cherish on no better grounds than that persons whose religious opinions are different from theirs, do not practise their religious observances, especially their religious abstinences end_token to cite a rather trivial example, nothing in the creed or practice of christians does more to envenom the hatred of mahomedans against them, than the fact of their eating pork end_token there are few acts which christians and europeans regard with more unaffected disgust, than mussulmans regard this particular mode of satisfying hunger end_token it is, in the first place, an offence against their religion; but this circumstance by no means explains either the degree or the kind of their repugnance; for wine also is forbidden by their religion, and to partake of it is by all mussulmans accounted wrong, but not disgusting end_token their aversion to the flesh of the \"unclean beast\" is, on the contrary, of that peculiar character, resembling an instinctive antipathy, which the idea of uncleanness, when once it thoroughly sinks into the feelings, seems always to excite even in those whose personal habits are anything but scrupulously cleanly, and of which the sentiment of religious impurity, so intense in the hindoos, is a remarkable example end_token suppose now that in a people, of whom the majority were mussulmans, that majority should insist upon not permitting pork to be eaten within the limits of the country end_token this would be nothing new in mahomedan countries end_token would it be a legitimate exercise of the moral authority of public opinion? and if not, why not? the practice is really revolting to such a public end_token they also sincerely think that it is forbidden and abhorred by the deity end_token neither could the prohibition be censured as religious persecution end_token it might be religious in its origin, but it would not be persecution for religion, since nobody's religion makes it a duty to eat pork end_token the only tenable ground of condemnation would be, that with the personal tastes and self-regarding concerns of individuals the public has no business to interfere end_token to come somewhat nearer home: the majority of spaniards consider it a gross impiety, offensive in the highest degree to the supreme being, to worship him in any other manner than the roman catholic; and no other public worship is lawful on spanish soil end_token the people of all southern europe look upon a married clergy as not only irreligious, but unchaste, indecent, gross, disgusting end_token what do protestants think of these perfectly sincere feelings, and of the attempt to enforce them against non-catholics? yet, if mankind are justified in interfering with each other's liberty in things which do not concern the interests of others, on what principle is it possible consistently to exclude these cases? or who can blame people for desiring to suppress what they regard as a scandal in the sight of god and man? no stronger case can be shown for prohibiting anything which is regarded as a personal immorality, than is made out for suppressing these practices in the eyes of those who regard them as impieties; and unless we are willing to adopt the logic of persecutors, and to say that we may persecute others because we are right, and that they must not persecute us because they are wrong, we must beware of admitting a principle of which we should resent as a gross injustice the application to ourselves end_token the preceding instances may be objected to, although unreasonably, as drawn from contingencies impossible among us: opinion, in this country, not being likely to enforce abstinence from meats, or to interfere with people for worshipping, and for either marrying or not marrying, according to their creed or inclination end_token the next example, however, shall be taken from an interference with liberty which we have by no means passed all danger of end_token wherever the puritans have been sufficiently powerful, as in new england, and in great britain at the time of the commonwealth, they have endeavoured, with considerable success, to put down all public, and nearly all private, amusements: especially music, dancing, public games, or other assemblages for purposes of diversion, and the theatre end_token there are still in this country large bodies of persons by whose notions of morality and religion these recreations are condemned; and those persons belonging chiefly to the middle class, who are the ascendant power in the present social and political condition of the kingdom, it is by no means impossible that persons of these sentiments may at some time or other command a majority in parliament end_token how will the remaining portion of the community like to have the amusements that shall be permitted to them regulated by the religious and moral sentiments of the stricter calvinists and methodists? would they not, with considerable peremptoriness, desire these intrusively pious members of society to mind their own business? this is precisely what should be said to every government and every public, who have the pretension that no person shall enjoy any pleasure which they think wrong end_token but if the principle of the pretension be admitted, no one can reasonably object to its being acted on in the sense of the majority, or other preponderating power in the country; and all persons must be ready to conform to the idea of a christian commonwealth, as understood by the early settlers in new england, if a religious profession similar to theirs should ever succeed in regaining its lost ground, as religions supposed to be declining have so often been known to do end_token to imagine another contingency, perhaps more likely to be realised than the one last mentioned end_token there is confessedly a strong tendency in the modern world towards a democratic constitution of society, accompanied or not by popular political institutions end_token it is affirmed that in the country where this tendency is most completely realised where both society and the government are most democratic the united states the feeling of the majority, to whom any appearance of a more showy or costly style of living than they can hope to rival is disagreeable, operates as a tolerably effectual sumptuary law, and that in many parts of the union it is really difficult for a person possessing a very large income, to find any mode of spending it, which will not incur popular disapprobation end_token though such statements as these are doubtless much exaggerated as a representation of existing facts, the state of things they describe is not only a conceivable and possible, but a probable result of democratic feeling, combined with the notion that the public has a right to a veto on the manner in which individuals shall spend their incomes end_token we have only further to suppose a considerable diffusion of socialist opinions, and it may become infamous in the eyes of the majority to possess more property than some very small amount, or any income not earned by manual labour end_token opinions similar in principle to these, already prevail widely among the artisan class, and weigh oppressively on those who are amenable to the opinion chiefly of that class, namely, its own members end_token it is known that the bad workmen who form the majority of the operatives in many branches of industry, are decidedly of opinion that bad workmen ought to receive the same wages as good, and that no one ought to be allowed, through piecework or otherwise, to earn by superior skill or industry more than others can without it end_token and they employ a moral police, which occasionally becomes a physical one, to deter skilful workmen from receiving, and employers from giving, a larger remuneration for a more useful service end_token if the public have any jurisdiction over private concerns, i cannot see that these people are in fault, or that any individual's particular public can be blamed for asserting the same authority over his individual conduct, which the general public asserts over people in general end_token but, without dwelling upon supposititious cases, there are, in our own day, gross usurpations upon the liberty of private life actually practised, and still greater ones threatened with some expectation of success, and opinions proposed which assert an unlimited right in the public not only to prohibit by law everything which it thinks wrong, but in order to get at what it thinks wrong, to prohibit any number of things which it admits to be innocent end_token under the name of preventing intemperance, the people of one english colony, and of nearly half the united states, have been interdicted by law from making any use whatever of fermented drinks, except for medical purposes: for prohibition of their sale is in fact, as it is intended to be, prohibition of their use end_token and though the impracticability of executing the law has caused its repeal in several of the states which had adopted it, including the one from which it derives its name, an attempt has notwithstanding been commenced, and is prosecuted with considerable zeal by many of the professed philanthropists, to agitate for a similar law in this country end_token the association, or \"alliance\" as it terms itself, which has been formed for this purpose, has acquired some notoriety through the publicity given to a correspondence between its secretary and one of the very few english public men who hold that a politician's opinions ought to be founded on principles end_token lord stanley's share in this correspondence is calculated to strengthen the hopes already built on him, by those who know how rare such qualities as are manifested in some of his public appearances, unhappily are among those who figure in political life end_token the organ of the alliance, who would \"deeply deplore the recognition of any principle which could be wrested to justify bigotry and persecution,\" undertakes to point out the \"broad and impassable barrier\" which divides such principles from those of the association end_token \"all matters relating to thought, opinion, conscience, appear to me,\" he says, \"to be without the sphere of legislation; all pertaining to social act, habit, relation, subject only to a discretionary power vested in the state itself, and not in the individual, to be within it end_token\" no mention is made of a third class, different from either of these, viz end_token acts and habits which are not social, but individual; although it is to this class, surely, that the act of drinking fermented liquors belongs end_token selling fermented liquors, however, is trading, and trading is a social act end_token but the infringement complained of is not on the liberty of the seller, but on that of the buyer and consumer; since the state might just as well forbid him to drink wine, as purposely make it impossible for him to obtain it end_token the secretary, however, says, \"i claim, as a citizen, a right to legislate whenever my social rights are invaded by the social act of another end_token\" and now for the definition of these \"social rights end_token\" \"if anything invades my social rights, certainly the traffic in strong drink does end_token it destroys my primary right of security, by constantly creating and stimulating social disorder end_token it invades my right of equality, by deriving a profit from the creation of a misery, i am taxed to support end_token it impedes my right to free moral and intellectual development, by surrounding my path with dangers, and by weakening and demoralising society, from which i have a right to claim mutual aid and intercourse end_token\" a theory of \"social rights,\" the like of which probably never before found its way into distinct language being nothing short of this that it is the absolute social right of every individual, that every other individual shall act in every respect exactly as he ought; that whosoever fails thereof in the smallest particular, violates my social right, and entitles me to demand from the legislature the removal of the grievance end_token so monstrous a principle is far more dangerous than any single interference with liberty; there is no violation of liberty which it would not justify; it acknowledges no right to any freedom whatever, except perhaps to that of holding opinions in secret, without ever disclosing them: for the moment an opinion which i consider noxious, passes any one's lips, it invades all the \"social rights\" attributed to me by the alliance end_token the doctrine ascribes to all mankind a vested interest in each other's moral, intellectual, and even physical perfection, to be defined by each claimant according to his own standard end_token another important example of illegitimate interference with the rightful liberty of the individual, not simply threatened, but long since carried into triumphant effect, is sabbatarian legislation end_token without doubt, abstinence on one day in the week, so far as the exigencies of life permit, from the usual daily occupation, though in no respect religiously binding on any except jews, is a highly beneficial custom end_token and inasmuch as this custom cannot be observed without a general consent to that effect among the industrious classes, therefore, in so far as some persons by working may impose the same necessity on others, it may be allowable and right that the law should guarantee to each, the observance by others of the custom, by suspending the greater operations of industry on a particular day end_token but this justification, grounded on the direct interest which others have in each individual's observance of the practice, does not apply to the self-chosen occupations in which a person may think fit to employ his leisure; nor does it hold good, in the smallest degree, for legal restrictions on amusements end_token it is true that the amusement of some is the day's work of others; but the pleasure, not to say the useful recreation, of many, is worth the labour of a few, provided the occupation is freely chosen, and can be freely resigned end_token the operatives are perfectly right in thinking that if all worked on sunday, seven days' work would have to be given for six days' wages: but so long as the great mass of employments are suspended, the small number who for the enjoyment of others must still work, obtain a proportional increase of earnings; and they are not obliged to follow those occupations, if they prefer leisure to emolument end_token if a further remedy is sought, it might be found in the establishment by custom of a holiday on some other day of the week for those particular classes of persons end_token the only ground, therefore, on which restrictions on sunday amusements can be defended, must be that they are religiously wrong; a motive of legislation which never can be too earnestly protested against end_token \"deorum injuriã¦ diis curã¦ end_token\" it remains to be proved that society or any of its officers holds a commission from on high to avenge any supposed offence to omnipotence, which is not also a wrong to our fellow-creatures end_token the notion that it is one man's duty that another should be religious, was the foundation of all the religious persecutions ever perpetrated, and if admitted, would fully justify them end_token though the feeling which breaks out in the repeated attempts to stop railway travelling on sunday, in the resistance to the opening of museums, and the like, has not the cruelty of the old persecutors, the state of mind indicated by it is fundamentally the same end_token it is a determination not to tolerate others in doing what is permitted by their religion, because it is not permitted by the persecutor's religion end_token it is a belief that god not only abominates the act of the misbeliever, but will not hold us guiltless if we leave him unmolested end_token i cannot refrain from adding to these examples of the little account commonly made of human liberty, the language of downright persecution which breaks out from the press of this country, whenever it feels called on to notice the remarkable phenomenon of mormonism end_token much might be said on the unexpected and instructive fact, that an alleged new revelation, and a religion founded on it, the product of palpable imposture, not even supported by the prestige of extraordinary qualities in its founder, is believed by hundreds of thousands, and has been made the foundation of a society, in the age of newspapers, railways, and the electric telegraph end_token what here concerns us is, that this religion, like other and better religions, has its martyrs; that its prophet and founder was, for his teaching, put to death by a mob; that others of its adherents lost their lives by the same lawless violence; that they were forcibly expelled, in a body, from the country in which they first grew up; while, now that they have been chased into a solitary recess in the midst of a desert, many in this country openly declare that it would be right (only that it is not convenient) to send an expedition against them, and compel them by force to conform to the opinions of other people end_token the article of the mormonite doctrine which is the chief provocative to the antipathy which thus breaks through the ordinary restraints of religious tolerance, is its sanction of polygamy; which, though permitted to mahomedans, and hindoos, and chinese, seems to excite unquenchable animosity when practised by persons who speak english, and profess to be a kind of christians end_token no one has a deeper disapprobation than i have of this mormon institution; both for other reasons, and because, far from being in any way countenanced by the principle of liberty, it is a direct infraction of that principle, being a mere riveting of the chains of one half of the community, and an emancipation of the other from reciprocity of obligation towards them end_token still, it must be remembered that this relation is as much voluntary on the part of the women concerned in it, and who may be deemed the sufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of the marriage institution; and however surprising this fact may appear, it has its explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, which teaching women to think marriage the one thing needful, make it intelligible that many a woman should prefer being one of several wives, to not being a wife at all end_token other countries are not asked to recognise such unions, or release any portion of their inhabitants from their own laws on the score of mormonite opinions end_token but when the dissentients have conceded to the hostile sentiments of others, far more than could justly be demanded; when they have left the countries to which their doctrines were unacceptable, and established themselves in a remote corner of the earth, which they have been the first to render habitable to human beings; it is difficult to see on what principles but those of tyranny they can be prevented from living there under what laws they please, provided they commit no aggression on other nations, and allow perfect freedom of departure to those who are dissatisfied with their ways end_token a recent writer, in some respects of considerable merit, proposes (to use his own words), not a crusade, but a _civilizade_, against this polygamous community, to put an end to what seems to him a retrograde step in civilisation end_token it also appears so to me, but i am not aware that any community has a right to force another to be civilised end_token so long as the sufferers by the bad law do not invoke assistance from other communities, i cannot admit that persons entirely unconnected with them ought to step in and require that a condition of things with which all who are directly interested appear to be satisfied, should be put an end to because it is a scandal to persons some thousands of miles distant, who have no part or concern in it end_token let them send missionaries, if they please, to preach against it; and let them, by any fair means (of which silencing the teachers is not one), oppose the progress of similar doctrines among their own people end_token if civilisation has got the better of barbarism when barbarism had the world to itself, it is too much to profess to be afraid lest barbarism, after having been fairly got under, should revive and conquer civilisation end_token a civilisation that can thus succumb to its vanquished enemy, must first have become so degenerate, that neither its appointed priests and teachers, nor anybody else, has the capacity, or will take the trouble, to stand up for it end_token if this be so, the sooner such a civilisation receives notice to quit, the better end_token it can only go on from bad to worse, until destroyed and regenerated (like the western empire) by energetic barbarians end_token the case of the bombay parsees is a curious instance in point end_token when this industrious and enterprising tribe, the descendants of the persian fire-worshippers, flying from their native country before the caliphs, arrived in western india, they were admitted to toleration by the hindoo sovereigns, on condition of not eating beef end_token when those regions afterwards fell under the dominion of mahomedan conquerors, the parsees obtained from them a continuance of indulgence, on condition of refraining from pork end_token what was at first obedience to authority became a second nature, and the parsees to this day abstain both from beef and pork end_token though not required by their religion, the double abstinence has had time to grow into a custom of their tribe; and custom, in the east, is a religion end_token the principles asserted in these pages must be more generally admitted as the basis for discussion of details, before a consistent application of them to all the various departments of government and morals can be attempted with any prospect of advantage end_token the few observations i propose to make on questions of detail, are designed to illustrate the principles, rather than to follow them out to their consequences end_token i offer, not so much applications, as specimens of application; which may serve to bring into greater clearness the meaning and limits of the two maxims which together form the entire doctrine of this essay, and to assist the judgment in holding the balance between them, in the cases where it appears doubtful which of them is applicable to the case end_token the maxims are, first, that the individual is not accountable to society for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no person but himself end_token advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the only measures by which society can justifiably express its dislike or disapprobation of his conduct end_token secondly, that for such actions as are prejudicial to the interests of others, the individual is accountable and may be subjected either to social or to legal punishments, if society is of opinion that the one or the other is requisite for its protection end_token in the first place, it must by no means be supposed, because damage, or probability of damage, to the interests of others, can alone justify the interference of society, that therefore it always does justify such interference end_token in many cases, an individual, in pursuing a legitimate object, necessarily and therefore legitimately causes pain or loss to others, or intercepts a good which they had a reasonable hope of obtaining end_token such oppositions of interest between individuals often arise from bad social institutions, but are unavoidable while those institutions last; and some would be unavoidable under any institutions end_token whoever succeeds in an overcrowded profession, or in a competitive examination; whoever is preferred to another in any contest for an object which both desire, reaps benefit from the loss of others, from their wasted exertion and their disappointment end_token but it is, by common admission, better for the general interest of mankind, that persons should pursue their objects undeterred by this sort of consequences end_token in other words, society admits no rights, either legal or moral, in the disappointed competitors, to immunity from this kind of suffering; and feels called on to interfere, only when means of success have been employed which it is contrary to the general interest to permit namely, fraud or treachery, and force end_token again, trade is a social act end_token whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society: accordingly, it was once held to be the duty of governments, in all cases which were considered of importance, to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture end_token but it is now recognised, though not till after a long struggle, that both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere end_token this is the so-called doctrine of free trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this essay end_token restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, quã¢ restraint, is an evil: but the restraints in question affect only that part of conduct which society is competent to restrain, and are wrong solely because they do not really produce the results which it is desired to produce by them end_token as the principle of individual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of free trade, so neither is it in most of the questions which arise respecting the limits of that doctrine: as for example, what amount of public control is admissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitary precautions, or arrangements to protect work-people employed in dangerous occupations, should be enforced on employers end_token such questions involve considerations of liberty, only in so far as leaving people to themselves is always better, _cã¦teris paribus_, than controlling them: but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is in principle undeniable end_token on the other hand, there are questions relating to interference with trade, which are essentially questions of liberty; such as the maine law, already touched upon; the prohibition of the importation of opium into china; the restriction of the sale of poisons; all cases, in short, where the object of the interference is to make it impossible or difficult to obtain a particular commodity end_token these interferences are objectionable, not as infringements on the liberty of the producer or seller, but on that of the buyer end_token one of these examples, that of the sale of poisons, opens a new question; the proper limits of what may be called the functions of police; how far liberty may legitimately be invaded for the prevention of crime, or of accident end_token it is one of the undisputed functions of government to take precautions against crime before it has been committed, as well as to detect and punish it afterwards end_token the preventive function of government, however, is far more liable to be abused, to the prejudice of liberty, than the punitory function; for there is hardly any part of the legitimate freedom of action of a human being which would not admit of being represented, and fairly too, as increasing the facilities for some form or other of delinquency end_token nevertheless, if a public authority, or even a private person, sees any one evidently preparing to commit a crime, they are not bound to look on inactive until the crime is committed, but may interfere to prevent it end_token if poisons were never bought or used for any purpose except the commission of murder, it would be right to prohibit their manufacture and sale end_token they may, however, be wanted not only for innocent but for useful purposes, and restrictions cannot be imposed in the one case without operating in the other end_token again, it is a proper office of public authority to guard against accidents end_token if either a public officer or any one else saw a person attempting to cross a bridge which had been ascertained to be unsafe, and there were no time to warn him of his danger, they might seize him and turn him back, without any real infringement of his liberty; for liberty consists in doing what one desires, and he does not desire to fall into the river end_token nevertheless, when there is not a certainty, but only a danger of mischief, no one but the person himself can judge of the sufficiency of the motive which may prompt him to incur the risk: in this case, therefore (unless he is a child, or delirious, or in some state of excitement or absorption incompatible with the full use of the reflecting faculty), he ought, i conceive, to be only warned of the danger; not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it end_token similar considerations, applied to such a question as the sale of poisons, may enable us to decide which among the possible modes of regulation are or are not contrary to principle end_token such a precaution, for example, as that of labelling the drug with some word expressive of its dangerous character, may be enforced without violation of liberty: the buyer cannot wish not to know that the thing he possesses has poisonous qualities end_token but to require in all cases the certificate of a medical practitioner, would make it sometimes impossible, always expensive, to obtain the article for legitimate uses end_token the only mode apparent to me, in which difficulties may be thrown in the way of crime committed through this means, without any infringement, worth taking into account, upon the liberty of those who desire the poisonous substance for other purposes, consists in providing what, in the apt language of bentham, is called \"preappointed evidence end_token\" this provision is familiar to every one in the case of contracts end_token it is usual and right that the law, when a contract is entered into, should require as the condition of its enforcing performance, that certain formalities should be observed, such as signatures, attestation of witnesses, and the like, in order that in case of subsequent dispute, there may be evidence to prove that the contract was really entered into, and that there was nothing in the circumstances to render it legally invalid: the effect being, to throw great obstacles in the way of fictitious contracts, or contracts made in circumstances which, if known, would destroy their validity end_token precautions of a similar nature might be enforced in the sale of articles adapted to be instruments of crime end_token the seller, for example, might be required to enter into a register the exact time of the transaction, the name and address of the buyer, the precise quality and quantity sold; to ask the purpose for which it was wanted, and record the answer he received end_token when there was no medical prescription, the presence of some third person might be required, to bring home the fact to the purchaser, in case there should afterwards be reason to believe that the article had been applied to criminal purposes end_token such regulations would in general be no material impediment to obtaining the article, but a very considerable one to making an improper use of it without detection end_token the right inherent in society, to ward off crimes against itself by antecedent precautions, suggests the obvious limitations to the maxim, that purely self-regarding misconduct cannot properly be meddled with in the way of prevention or punishment end_token drunkenness, for example, in ordinary cases, is not a fit subject for legislative interference; but i should deem it perfectly legitimate that a person, who had once been convicted of any act of violence to others under the influence of drink, should be placed under a special legal restriction, personal to himself; that if he were afterwards found drunk, he should be liable to a penalty, and that if when in that state he committed another offence, the punishment to which he would be liable for that other offence should be increased in severity end_token the making himself drunk, in a person whom drunkenness excites to do harm to others, is a crime against others end_token so, again, idleness, except in a person receiving support from the public, or except when it constitutes a breach of contract, cannot without tyranny be made a subject of legal punishment; but if either from idleness or from any other avoidable cause, a man fails to perform his legal duties to others, as for instance to support his children, it is no tyranny to force him to fulfil that obligation, by compulsory labour, if no other means are available end_token again, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to the agents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which, if done publicly, are a violation of good manners and coming thus within the category of offences against others may rightfully be prohibited end_token of this kind are offences against decency; on which it is unnecessary to dwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with our subject, the objection to publicity being equally strong in the case of many actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be so end_token there is another question to which an answer must be found, consistent with the principles which have been laid down end_token in cases of personal conduct supposed to be blamable, but which respect for liberty precludes society from preventing or punishing, because the evil directly resulting falls wholly on the agent; what the agent is free to do, ought other persons to be equally free to counsel or instigate? this question is not free from difficulty end_token the case of a person who solicits another to do an act, is not strictly a case of self-regarding conduct end_token to give advice or offer inducements to any one, is a social act, and may therefore, like actions in general which affect others, be supposed amenable to social control end_token but a little reflection corrects the first impression, by showing that if the case is not strictly within the definition of individual liberty, yet the reasons on which the principle of individual liberty is grounded, are applicable to it end_token if people must be allowed, in whatever concerns only themselves, to act as seems best to themselves at their own peril, they must equally be free to consult with one another about what is fit to be so done; to exchange opinions, and give and receive suggestions end_token whatever it is permitted to do, it must be permitted to advise to do end_token the question is doubtful, only when the instigator derives a personal benefit from his advice; when he makes it his occupation, for subsistence or pecuniary gain, to promote what society and the state consider to be an evil end_token then, indeed, a new element of complication is introduced; namely, the existence of classes of persons with an interest opposed to what is considered as the public weal, and whose mode of living is grounded on the counteraction of it end_token ought this to be interfered with, or not? fornication, for example, must be tolerated, and so must gambling; but should a person be free to be a pimp, or to keep a gambling-house? the case is one of those which lie on the exact boundary line between two principles, and it is not at once apparent to which of the two it properly belongs end_token there are arguments on both sides end_token on the side of toleration it may be said, that the fact of following anything as an occupation, and living or profiting by the practice of it, cannot make that criminal which would otherwise be admissible; that the act should either be consistently permitted or consistently prohibited; that if the principles which we have hitherto defended are true, society has no business, as society, to decide anything to be wrong which concerns only the individual; that it cannot go beyond dissuasion, and that one person should be as free to persuade, as another to dissuade end_token in opposition to this it may be contended, that although the public, or the state, are not warranted in authoritatively deciding, for purposes of repression or punishment, that such or such conduct affecting only the interests of the individual is good or bad, they are fully justified in assuming, if they regard it as bad, that its being so or not is at least a disputable question: that, this being supposed, they cannot be acting wrongly in endeavouring to exclude the influence of solicitations which are not disinterested, of instigators who cannot possibly be impartial who have a direct personal interest on one side, and that side the one which the state believes to be wrong, and who confessedly promote it for personal objects only end_token there can surely, it may be urged, be nothing lost, no sacrifice of good, by so ordering matters that persons shall make their election, either wisely or foolishly, on their own prompting, as free as possible from the arts of persons who stimulate their inclinations for interested purposes of their own end_token thus (it may be said) though the statutes respecting unlawful games are utterly indefensible though all persons should be free to gamble in their own or each other's houses, or in any place of meeting established by their own subscriptions, and open only to the members and their visitors yet public gambling-houses should not be permitted end_token it is true that the prohibition is never effectual, and that whatever amount of tyrannical power is given to the police, gambling-houses can always be maintained under other pretences; but they may be compelled to conduct their operations with a certain degree of secrecy and mystery, so that nobody knows anything about them but those who seek them; and more than this, society ought not to aim at end_token there is considerable force in these arguments; i will not venture to decide whether they are sufficient to justify the moral anomaly of punishing the accessary, when the principal is (and must be) allowed to go free; or fining or imprisoning the procurer, but not the fornicator, the gambling-house keeper, but not the gambler end_token still less ought the common operations of buying and selling to be interfered with on analogous grounds end_token almost every article which is bought and sold may be used in excess, and the sellers have a pecuniary interest in encouraging that excess; but no argument can be founded on this, in favour, for instance, of the maine law; because the class of dealers in strong drinks, though interested in their abuse, are indispensably required for the sake of their legitimate use end_token the interest, however, of these dealers in promoting intemperance is a real evil, and justifies the state in imposing restrictions and requiring guarantees, which but for that justification would be infringements of legitimate liberty end_token a further question is, whether the state, while it permits, should nevertheless indirectly discourage conduct which it deems contrary to the best interests of the agent; whether, for example, it should take measures to render the means of drunkenness more costly, or add to the difficulty of procuring them, by limiting the number of the places of sale end_token on this as on most other practical questions, many distinctions require to be made end_token to tax stimulants for the sole purpose of making them more difficult to be obtained, is a measure differing only in degree from their entire prohibition; and would be justifiable only if that were justifiable end_token every increase of cost is a prohibition, to those whose means do not come up to the augmented price; and to those who do, it is a penalty laid on them for gratifying a particular taste end_token their choice of pleasures, and their mode of expending their income, after satisfying their legal and moral obligations to the state and to individuals, are their own concern, and must rest with their own judgment end_token these considerations may seem at first sight to condemn the selection of stimulants as special subjects of taxation for purposes of revenue end_token but it must be remembered that taxation for fiscal purposes is absolutely inevitable; that in most countries it is necessary that a considerable part of that taxation should be indirect; that the state, therefore, cannot help imposing penalties, which to some persons may be prohibitory, on the use of some articles of consumption end_token it is hence the duty of the state to consider, in the imposition of taxes, what commodities the consumers can best spare; and _ã fortiori_, to select in preference those of which it deems the use, beyond a very moderate quantity, to be positively injurious end_token taxation, therefore, of stimulants, up to the point which produces the largest amount of revenue (supposing that the state needs all the revenue which it yields) is not only admissible, but to be approved of end_token the question of making the sale of these commodities a more or less exclusive privilege, must be answered differently, according to the purposes to which the restriction is intended to be subservient end_token all places of public resort require the restraint of a police, and places of this kind peculiarly, because offences against society are especially apt to originate there end_token it is, therefore, fit to confine the power of selling these commodities (at least for consumption on the spot) to persons of known or vouched-for respectability of conduct; to make such regulations respecting hours of opening and closing as may be requisite for public surveillance, and to withdraw the licence if breaches of the peace repeatedly take place through the connivance or incapacity of the keeper of the house, or if it becomes a rendezvous for concocting and preparing offences against the law end_token any further restriction i do not conceive to be, in principle, justifiable end_token the limitation in number, for instance, of beer and spirit-houses, for the express purpose of rendering them more difficult of access, and diminishing the occasions of temptation, not only exposes all to an inconvenience because there are some by whom the facility would be abused, but is suited only to a state of society in which the labouring classes are avowedly treated as children or savages, and placed under an education of restraint, to fit them for future admission to the privileges of freedom end_token this is not the principle on which the labouring classes are professedly governed in any free country; and no person who sets due value on freedom will give his adhesion to their being so governed, unless after all efforts have been exhausted to educate them for freedom and govern them as freemen, and it has been definitively proved that they can only be governed as children end_token the bare statement of the alternative shows the absurdity of supposing that such efforts have been made in any case which needs be considered here end_token it is only because the institutions of this country are a mass of inconsistencies, that things find admittance into our practice which belong to the system of despotic, or what is called paternal, government, while the general freedom of our institutions precludes the exercise of the amount of control necessary to render the restraint of any real efficacy as a moral education end_token it was pointed out in an early part of this essay, that the liberty of the individual, in things wherein the individual is alone concerned, implies a corresponding liberty in any number of individuals to regulate by mutual agreement such things as regard them jointly, and regard no persons but themselves end_token this question presents no difficulty, so long as the will of all the persons implicated remains unaltered; but since that will may change, it is often necessary, even in things in which they alone are concerned, that they should enter into engagements with one another; and when they do, it is fit, as a general rule, that those engagements should be kept end_token yet in the laws, probably, of every country, this general rule has some exceptions end_token not only persons are not held to engagements which violate the rights of third parties, but it is sometimes considered a sufficient reason for releasing them from an engagement, that it is injurious to themselves end_token in this and most other civilised countries, for example, an engagement by which a person should sell himself, or allow himself to be sold, as a slave, would be null and void; neither enforced by law nor by opinion end_token the ground for thus limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in life, is apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case end_token the reason for not interfering, unless for the sake of others, with a person's voluntary acts, is consideration for his liberty end_token his voluntary choice is evidence that what he so chooses is desirable, or at the least endurable, to him, and his good is on the whole best provided for by allowing him to take his own means of pursuing it end_token but by selling himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty; he foregoes any future use of it, beyond that single act end_token he therefore defeats, in his own case, the very purpose which is the justification of allowing him to dispose of himself end_token he is no longer free; but is thenceforth in a position which has no longer the presumption in its favour, that would be afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it end_token the principle of freedom cannot require that he should be free not to be free end_token it is not freedom, to be allowed to alienate his freedom end_token these reasons, the force of which is so conspicuous in this peculiar case, are evidently of far wider application; yet a limit is everywhere set to them by the necessities of life, which continually require, not indeed that we should resign our freedom, but that we should consent to this and the other limitation of it end_token the principle, however, which demands uncontrolled freedom of action in all that concerns only the agents themselves, requires that those who have become bound to one another, in things which concern no third party, should be able to release one another from the engagement: and even without such voluntary release, there are perhaps no contracts or engagements, except those that relate to money or money's worth, of which one can venture to say that there ought to be no liberty whatever of retractation end_token baron wilhelm von humboldt, in the excellent essay from which i have already quoted, states it as his conviction, that engagements which involve personal relations or services, should never be legally binding beyond a limited duration of time; and that the most important of these engagements, marriage, having the peculiarity that its objects are frustrated unless the feelings of both the parties are in harmony with it, should require nothing more than the declared will of either party to dissolve it end_token this subject is too important, and too complicated, to be discussed in a parenthesis, and i touch on it only so far as is necessary for purposes of illustration end_token if the conciseness and generality of baron humboldt's dissertation had not obliged him in this instance to content himself with enunciating his conclusion without discussing the premises, he would doubtless have recognised that the question cannot be decided on grounds so simple as those to which he confines himself end_token when a person, either by express promise or by conduct, has encouraged another to rely upon his continuing to act in a certain way to build expectations and calculations, and stake any part of his plan of life upon that supposition, a new series of moral obligations arises on his part towards that person, which may possibly be overruled, but cannot be ignored end_token and again, if the relation between two contracting parties has been followed by consequences to others; if it has placed third parties in any peculiar position, or, as in the case of marriage, has even called third parties into existence, obligations arise on the part of both the contracting parties towards those third persons, the fulfilment of which, or at all events the mode of fulfilment, must be greatly affected by the continuance or disruption of the relation between the original parties to the contract end_token it does not follow, nor can i admit, that these obligations extend to requiring the fulfilment of the contract at all costs to the happiness of the reluctant party; but they are a necessary element in the question; and even if, as von humboldt maintains, they ought to make no difference in the legal freedom of the parties to release themselves from the engagement (and i also hold that they ought not to make much difference), they necessarily make a great difference in the moral freedom end_token a person is bound to take all these circumstances into account, before resolving on a step which may affect such important interests of others; and if he does not allow proper weight to those interests, he is morally responsible for the wrong end_token i have made these obvious remarks for the better illustration of the general principle of liberty, and not because they are at all needed on the particular question, which, on the contrary, is usually discussed as if the interest of children was everything, and that of grown persons nothing end_token i have already observed that, owing to the absence of any recognised general principles, liberty is often granted where it should be withheld, as well as withheld where it should be granted; and one of the cases in which, in the modern european world, the sentiment of liberty is the strongest, is a case where, in my view, it is altogether misplaced end_token a person should be free to do as he likes in his own concerns; but he ought not to be free to do as he likes in acting for another, under the pretext that the affairs of another are his own affairs end_token the state, while it respects the liberty of each in what specially regards himself, is bound to maintain a vigilant control over his exercise of any power which it allows him to possess over others end_token this obligation is almost entirely disregarded in the case of the family relations, a case, in its direct influence on human happiness, more important than all others taken together end_token the almost despotic power of husbands over wives need not be enlarged upon here because nothing more is needed for the complete removal of the evil, than that wives should have the same rights, and should receive the protection of law in the same manner, as all other persons; and because, on this subject, the defenders of established injustice do not avail themselves of the plea of liberty, but stand forth openly as the champions of power end_token it is in the case of children, that misapplied notions of liberty are a real obstacle to the fulfilment by the state of its duties end_token one would almost think that a man's children were supposed to be literally, and not metaphorically, a part of himself, so jealous is opinion of the smallest interference of law with his absolute and exclusive control over them; more jealous than of almost any interference with his own freedom of action: so much less do the generality of mankind value liberty than power end_token consider, for example, the case of education end_token is it not almost a self-evident axiom, that the state should require and compel the education, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is born its citizen? yet who is there that is not afraid to recognise and assert this truth? hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of the most sacred duties of the parents (or, as law and usage now stand, the father), after summoning a human being into the world, to give to that being an education fitting him to perform his part well in life towards others and towards himself end_token but while this is unanimously declared to be the father's duty, scarcely anybody, in this country, will bear to hear of obliging him to perform it end_token instead of his being required to make any exertion or sacrifice for securing education to the child, it is left to his choice to accept it or not when it is provided gratis! it still remains unrecognised, that to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind, is a moral crime, both against the unfortunate offspring and against society; and that if the parent does not fulfil this obligation, the state ought to see it fulfilled, at the charge, as far as possible, of the parent end_token were the duty of enforcing universal education once admitted, there would be an end to the difficulties about what the state should teach, and how it should teach, which now convert the subject into a mere battle-field for sects and parties, causing the time and labour which should have been spent in educating, to be wasted in quarrelling about education end_token if the government would make up its mind to require for every child a good education, it might save itself the trouble of providing one end_token it might leave to parents to obtain the education where and how they pleased, and content itself with helping to pay the school fees of the poorer class of children, and defraying the entire school expenses of those who have no one else to pay for them end_token the objections which are urged with reason against state education, do not apply to the enforcement of education by the state, but to the state's taking upon itself to direct that education; which is a totally different thing end_token that the whole or any large part of the education of the people should be in state hands, i go as far as any one in deprecating end_token all that has been said of the importance of individuality of character, and diversity in opinions and modes of conduct, involves, as of the same unspeakable importance, diversity of education end_token a general state education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another; and as the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the government, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an aristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation, in proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by natural tendency to one over the body end_token an education established and controlled by the state, should only exist, if it exist at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose of example and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain standard of excellence end_token unless, indeed, when society in general is in so backward a state that it could not or would not provide for itself any proper institutions of education, unless the government undertook the task; then, indeed, the government may, as the less of two great evils, take upon itself the business of schools and universities, as it may that of joint stock companies, when private enterprise, in a shape fitted for undertaking great works of industry, does not exist in the country end_token but in general, if the country contains a sufficient number of persons qualified to provide education under government auspices, the same persons would be able and willing to give an equally good education on the voluntary principle, under the assurance of remuneration afforded by a law rendering education compulsory, combined with state aid to those unable to defray the expense end_token the instrument for enforcing the law could be no other than public examinations, extending to all children, and beginning at an early age end_token an age might be fixed at which every child must be examined, to ascertain if he (or she) is able to read end_token if a child proves unable, the father, unless he has some sufficient ground of excuse, might be subjected to a moderate fine, to be worked out, if necessary, by his labour, and the child might be put to school at his expense end_token once in every year the examination should be renewed, with a gradually extending range of subjects, so as to make the universal acquisition, and what is more, retention, of a certain minimum of general knowledge, virtually compulsory end_token beyond that minimum, there should be voluntary examinations on all subjects, at which all who come up to a certain standard of proficiency might claim a certificate end_token to prevent the state from exercising, through these arrangements, an improper influence over opinion, the knowledge required for passing an examination (beyond the merely instrumental parts of knowledge, such as languages and their use) should, even in the higher class of examinations, be confined to facts and positive science exclusively end_token the examinations on religion, politics, or other disputed topics, should not turn on the truth or falsehood of opinions, but on the matter of fact that such and such an opinion is held, on such grounds, by such authors, or schools, or churches end_token under this system, the rising generation would be no worse off in regard to all disputed truths, than they are at present; they would be brought up either churchmen or dissenters as they now are, the state merely taking care that they should be instructed churchmen, or instructed dissenters end_token there would be nothing to hinder them from being taught religion, if their parents chose, at the same schools where they were taught other things end_token all attempts by the state to bias the conclusions of its citizens on disputed subjects, are evil; but it may very properly offer to ascertain and certify that a person possesses the knowledge, requisite to make his conclusions, on any given subject, worth attending to end_token a student of philosophy would be the better for being able to stand an examination both in locke and in kant, whichever of the two he takes up with, or even if with neither: and there is no reasonable objection to examining an atheist in the evidences of christianity, provided he is not required to profess a belief in them end_token the examinations, however, in the higher branches of knowledge should, i conceive, be entirely voluntary end_token it would be giving too dangerous a power to governments, were they allowed to exclude any one from professions, even from the profession of teacher, for alleged deficiency of qualifications: and i think, with wilhelm von humboldt, that degrees, or other public certificates of scientific or professional acquirements, should be given to all who present themselves for examination, and stand the test; but that such certificates should confer no advantage over competitors, other than the weight which may be attached to their testimony by public opinion end_token it is not in the matter of education only, that misplaced notions of liberty prevent moral obligations on the part of parents from being recognised, and legal obligations from being imposed, where there are the strongest grounds for the former always, and in many cases for the latter also end_token the fact itself, of causing the existence of a human being, is one of the most responsible actions in the range of human life end_token to undertake this responsibility to bestow a life which may be either a curse or a blessing unless the being on whom it is to be bestowed will have at least the ordinary chances of a desirable existence, is a crime against that being end_token and in a country either over-peopled, or threatened with being so, to produce children, beyond a very small number, with the effect of reducing the reward of labour by their competition, is a serious offence against all who live by the remuneration of their labour end_token the laws which, in many countries on the continent, forbid marriage unless the parties can show that they have the means of supporting a family, do not exceed the legitimate powers of the state: and whether such laws be expedient or not (a question mainly dependent on local circumstances and feelings), they are not objectionable as violations of liberty end_token such laws are interferences of the state to prohibit a mischievous act an act injurious to others, which ought to be a subject of reprobation, and social stigma, even when it is not deemed expedient to superadd legal punishment end_token yet the current ideas of liberty, which bend so easily to real infringements of the freedom of the individual, in things which concern only himself, would repel the attempt to put any restraint upon his inclinations when the consequence of their indulgence is a life, or lives, of wretchedness and depravity to the offspring, with manifold evils to those sufficiently within reach to be in any way affected by their actions end_token when we compare the strange respect of mankind for liberty, with their strange want of respect for it, we might imagine that a man had an indispensable right to do harm to others, and no right at all to please himself without giving pain to any one end_token i have reserved for the last place a large class of questions respecting the limits of government interference, which, though closely connected with the subject of this essay, do not, in strictness, belong to it end_token these are cases in which the reasons against interference do not turn upon the principle of liberty: the question is not about restraining the actions of individuals, but about helping them: it is asked whether the government should do, or cause to be done, something for their benefit, instead of leaving it to be done by themselves, individually, or in voluntary combination end_token the objections to government interference, when it is not such as to involve infringement of liberty, may be of three kinds end_token the first is, when the thing to be done is likely to be better done by individuals than by the government end_token speaking generally, there is no one so fit to conduct any business, or to determine how or by whom it shall be conducted, as those who are personally interested in it end_token this principle condemns the interferences, once so common, of the legislature, or the officers of government, with the ordinary processes of industry end_token but this part of the subject has been sufficiently enlarged upon by political economists, and is not particularly related to the principles of this essay end_token the second objection is more nearly allied to our subject end_token in many cases, though individuals may not do the particular thing so well, on the average, as the officers of government, it is nevertheless desirable that it should be done by them, rather than by the government, as a means to their own mental education a mode of strengthening their active faculties, exercising their judgment, and giving them a familiar knowledge of the subjects with which they are thus left to deal end_token this is a principal, though not the sole, recommendation of jury trial (in cases not political); of free and popular local and municipal institutions; of the conduct of industrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntary associations end_token these are not questions of liberty, and are connected with that subject only by remote tendencies; but they are questions of development end_token it belongs to a different occasion from the present to dwell on these things as parts of national education; as being, in truth, the peculiar training of a citizen, the practical part of the political education of a free people, taking them out of the narrow circle of personal and family selfishness, and accustoming them to the comprehension of joint interests, the management of joint concerns habituating them to act from public or semi-public motives, and guide their conduct by aims which unite instead of isolating them from one another end_token without these habits and powers, a free constitution can neither be worked nor preserved, as is exemplified by the too-often transitory nature of political freedom in countries where it does not rest upon a sufficient basis of local liberties end_token the management of purely local business by the localities, and of the great enterprises of industry by the union of those who voluntarily supply the pecuniary means, is further recommended by all the advantages which have been set forth in this essay as belonging to individuality of development, and diversity of modes of action end_token government operations tend to be everywhere alike end_token with individuals and voluntary associations, on the contrary, there are varied experiments, and endless diversity of experience end_token what the state can usefully do, is to make itself a central depository, and active circulator and diffuser, of the experience resulting from many trials end_token its business is to enable each experimentalist to benefit by the experiments of others, instead of tolerating no experiments but its own end_token the third, and most cogent reason for restricting the interference of government, is the great evil of adding unnecessarily to its power end_token every function superadded to those already exercised by the government, causes its influence over hopes and fears to be more widely diffused, and converts, more and more, the active and ambitious part of the public into hangers-on of the government, or of some party which aims at becoming the government end_token if the roads, the railways, the banks, the insurance offices, the great joint-stock companies, the universities, and the public charities, were all of them branches of the government; if, in addition, the municipal corporations and local boards, with all that now devolves on them, became departments of the central administration; if the employã©s of all these different enterprises were appointed and paid by the government, and looked to the government for every rise in life; not all the freedom of the press and popular constitution of the legislature would make this or any other country free otherwise than in name end_token and the evil would be greater, the more efficiently and scientifically the administrative machinery was constructed the more skilful the arrangements for obtaining the best qualified hands and heads with which to work it end_token in england it has of late been proposed that all the members of the civil service of government should be selected by competitive examination, to obtain for those employments the most intelligent and instructed persons procurable; and much has been said and written for and against this proposal end_token one of the arguments most insisted on by its opponents, is that the occupation of a permanent official servant of the state does not hold out sufficient prospects of emolument and importance to attract the highest talents, which will always be able to find a more inviting career in the professions, or in the service of companies and other public bodies end_token one would not have been surprised if this argument had been used by the friends of the proposition, as an answer to its principal difficulty end_token coming from the opponents it is strange enough end_token what is urged as an objection is the safety-valve of the proposed system end_token if indeed all the high talent of the country could be drawn into the service of the government, a proposal tending to bring about that result might well inspire uneasiness end_token if every part of the business of society which required organised concert, or large and comprehensive views, were in the hands of the government, and if government offices were universally filled by the ablest men, all the enlarged culture and practised intelligence in the country, except the purely speculative, would be concentrated in a numerous bureaucracy, to whom alone the rest of the community would look for all things: the multitude for direction and dictation in all they had to do; the able and aspiring for personal advancement end_token to be admitted into the ranks of this bureaucracy, and when admitted, to rise therein, would be the sole objects of ambition end_token under this rã©gime, not only is the outside public ill-qualified, for want of practical experience, to criticise or check the mode of operation of the bureaucracy, but even if the accidents of despotic or the natural working of popular institutions occasionally raise to the summit a ruler or rulers of reforming inclinations, no reform can be effected which is contrary to the interest of the bureaucracy end_token such is the melancholy condition of the russian empire, as is shown in the accounts of those who have had sufficient opportunity of observation end_token the czar himself is powerless against the bureaucratic body; he can send any one of them to siberia, but he cannot govern without them, or against their will end_token on every decree of his they have a tacit veto, by merely refraining from carrying it into effect end_token in countries of more advanced civilisation and of a more insurrectionary spirit, the public, accustomed to expect everything to be done for them by the state, or at least to do nothing for themselves without asking from the state not only leave to do it, but even how it is to be done, naturally hold the state responsible for all evil which befalls them, and when the evil exceeds their amount of patience, they rise against the government and make what is called a revolution; whereupon somebody else, with or without legitimate authority from the nation, vaults into the seat, issues his orders to the bureaucracy, and everything goes on much as it did before; the bureaucracy being unchanged, and nobody else being capable of taking their place end_token a very different spectacle is exhibited among a people accustomed to transact their own business end_token in france, a large part of the people having been engaged in military service, many of whom have held at least the rank of non-commissioned officers, there are in every popular insurrection several persons competent to take the lead, and improvise some tolerable plan of action end_token what the french are in military affairs, the americans are in every kind of civil business; let them be left without a government, every body of americans is able to improvise one, and to carry on that or any other public business with a sufficient amount of intelligence, order, and decision end_token this is what every free people ought to be: and a people capable of this is certain to be free; it will never let itself be enslaved by any man or body of men because these are able to seize and pull the reins of the central administration end_token no bureaucracy can hope to make such a people as this do or undergo anything that they do not like end_token but where everything is done through the bureaucracy, nothing to which the bureaucracy is really adverse can be done at all end_token the constitution of such countries is an organisation of the experience and practical ability of the nation, into a disciplined body for the purpose of governing the rest; and the more perfect that organisation is in itself, the more successful in drawing to itself and educating for itself the persons of greatest capacity from all ranks of the community, the more complete is the bondage of all, the members of the bureaucracy included end_token for the governors are as much the slaves of their organisation and discipline, as the governed are of the governors end_token a chinese mandarin is as much the tool and creature of a despotism as the humblest cultivator end_token an individual jesuit is to the utmost degree of abasement the slave of his order, though the order itself exists for the collective power and importance of its members end_token it is not, also, to be forgotten, that the absorption of all the principal ability of the country into the governing body is fatal, sooner or later, to the mental activity and progressiveness of the body itself end_token banded together as they are working a system which, like all systems, necessarily proceeds in a great measure by fixed rules the official body are under the constant temptation of sinking into indolent routine, or, if they now and then desert that mill-horse round, of rushing into some half-examined crudity which has struck the fancy of some leading member of the corps: and the sole check to these closely allied, though seemingly opposite, tendencies, the only stimulus which can keep the ability of the body itself up to a high standard, is liability to the watchful criticism of equal ability outside the body end_token it is indispensable, therefore, that the means should exist, independently of the government, of forming such ability, and furnishing it with the opportunities and experience necessary for a correct judgment of great practical affairs end_token if we would possess permanently a skilful and efficient body of functionaries above all, a body able to originate and willing to adopt improvements; if we would not have our bureaucracy degenerate into a pedantocracy, this body must not engross all the occupations which form and cultivate the faculties required for the government of mankind end_token to determine the point at which evils, so formidable to human freedom and advancement, begin, or rather at which they begin to predominate over the benefits attending the collective application of the force of society, under its recognised chiefs, for the removal of the obstacles which stand in the way of its well-being; to secure as much of the advantages of centralised power and intelligence, as can be had without turning into governmental channels too great a proportion of the general activity, is one of the most difficult and complicated questions in the art of government end_token it is, in a great measure, a question of detail, in which many and various considerations must be kept in view, and no absolute rule can be laid down end_token but i believe that the practical principle in which safety resides, the ideal to be kept in view, the standard by which to test all arrangements intended for overcoming the difficulty, may be conveyed in these words: the greatest dissemination of power consistent with efficiency; but the greatest possible centralisation of information, and diffusion of it from the centre end_token thus, in municipal administration, there would be, as in the new england states, a very minute division among separate officers, chosen by the localities, of all business which is not better left to the persons directly interested; but besides this, there would be, in each department of local affairs, a central superintendence, forming a branch of the general government end_token the organ of this superintendence would concentrate, as in a focus, the variety of information and experience derived from the conduct of that branch of public business in all the localities, from everything analogous which is done in foreign countries, and from the general principles of political science end_token this central organ should have a right to know all that is done, and its special duty should be that of making the knowledge acquired in one place available for others end_token emancipated from the petty prejudices and narrow views of a locality by its elevated position and comprehensive sphere of observation, its advice would naturally carry much authority; but its actual power, as a permanent institution, should, i conceive, be limited to compelling the local officers to obey the laws laid down for their guidance end_token in all things not provided for by general rules, those officers should be left to their own judgment, under responsibility to their constituents end_token for the violation of rules, they should be responsible to law, and the rules themselves should be laid down by the legislature; the central administrative authority only watching over their execution, and if they were not properly carried into effect, appealing, according to the nature of the case, to the tribunal to enforce the law, or to the constituencies to dismiss the functionaries who had not executed it according to its spirit end_token such, in its general conception, is the central superintendence which the poor law board is intended to exercise over the administrators of the poor rate throughout the country end_token whatever powers the board exercises beyond this limit, were right and necessary in that peculiar case, for the cure of rooted habits of maladministration in matters deeply affecting not the localities merely, but the whole community; since no locality has a moral right to make itself by mismanagement a nest of pauperism, necessarily overflowing into other localities, and impairing the moral and physical condition of the whole labouring community end_token the powers of administrative coercion and subordinate legislation possessed by the poor law board (but which, owing to the state of opinion on the subject, are very scantily exercised by them), though perfectly justifiable in a case of first-rate national interest, would be wholly out of place in the superintendence of interests purely local end_token but a central organ of information and instruction for all the localities, would be equally valuable in all departments of administration end_token a government cannot have too much of the kind of activity which does not impede, but aids and stimulates, individual exertion and development end_token the mischief begins when, instead of calling forth the activity and powers of individuals and bodies, it substitutes its own activity for theirs; when, instead of informing, advising, and, upon occasion, denouncing, it makes them work in fetters, or bids them stand aside and does their work instead of them end_token the worth of a state, in the long run, is the worth of the individuals composing it; and a state which postpones the interests of their mental expansion and elevation, to a little more of administrative skill, or of that semblance of it which practice gives, in the details of business; a state which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes, will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished; and that the perfection of machinery to which it has sacrificed everything, will in the end avail it nothing, for want of the vital power which, in order that the machine might work more smoothly, it has preferred to banish end_token "

      " end_token ï»¿the subject of this essay is not the so-called liberty of the will, sounfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of philosophicalnecessity; but civil, or social liberty: the nature and limits of thepower which can be legitimately exercised by society over theindividual end_token a question seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, ingeneral terms, but which profoundly influences the practicalcontroversies of the age by its latent presence, and is likely soon tomake itself recognised as the vital question of the future end_token it is so farfrom being new, that in a certain sense, it has divided mankind, almostfrom the remotest ages; but in the stage of progress into which the morecivilised portions of the species have now entered, it presents itselfunder new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamentaltreatment end_tokenthe struggle between liberty and authority is the most conspicuousfeature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar,particularly in that of greece, rome, and england end_token but in old times thiscontest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and thegovernment end_token by liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of thepolitical rulers end_token the rulers were conceived (except in some of thepopular governments of greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic positionto the people whom they ruled end_token they consisted of a governing one, or agoverning tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritanceor conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of thegoverned, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did notdesire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against itsoppressive exercise end_token their power was regarded as necessary, but also ashighly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use againsttheir subjects, no less than against external enemies end_token to prevent theweaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerablevultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of preystronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down end_token but as the kingof the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than anyof the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitudeof defence against his beak and claws end_token the aim, therefore, of patriots,was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered toexercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant byliberty end_token it was attempted in two ways end_token first, by obtaining a recognitionof certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which itwas to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, andwhich if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, washeld to be justifiable end_token a second, and generally a later expedient, wasthe establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of thecommunity, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent itsinterests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more importantacts of the governing power end_token to the first of these modes of limitation,the ruling power, in most european countries, was compelled, more orless, to submit end_token it was not so with the second; and to attain this, orwhen already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely,became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty end_token and solong as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to beruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or lessefficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirationsbeyond this point end_tokena time, however, came, in the progress of human affairs, when men ceasedto think it a necessity of nature that their governors should be anindependent power, opposed in interest to themselves end_token it appeared tothem much better that the various magistrates of the state should betheir tenants or delegates, revocable at their pleasure end_token in that wayalone, it seemed, could they have complete security that the powers ofgovernment would never be abused to their disadvantage end_token by degrees, thisnew demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent objectof the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed;and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limitthe power of rulers end_token as the struggle proceeded for making the rulingpower emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, some personsbegan to think that too much importance had been attached to thelimitation of the power itself end_token that (it might seem) was a resourceagainst rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of thepeople end_token what was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identifiedwith the people; that their interest and will should be the interest andwill of the nation end_token the nation did not need to be protected against itsown will end_token there was no fear of its tyrannising over itself end_token let therulers be effectually responsible to it, promptly removable by it, andit could afford to trust them with power of which it could itselfdictate the use to be made end_token their power was but the nation's own power,concentrated, and in a form convenient for exercise end_token this mode ofthought, or rather perhaps of feeling, was common among the lastgeneration of european liberalism, in the continental section of whichit still apparently predominates end_token those who admit any limit to what agovernment may do, except in the case of such governments as they thinkought not to exist, stand out as brilliant exceptions among thepolitical thinkers of the continent end_token a similar tone of sentiment mightby this time have been prevalent in our own country, if thecircumstances which for a time encouraged it, had continued unaltered end_tokenbut, in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons,success discloses faults and infirmities which failure might haveconcealed from observation end_token the notion, that the people have no need tolimit their power over themselves, might seem axiomatic, when populargovernment was a thing only dreamed about, or read of as having existedat some distant period of the past end_token neither was that notion necessarilydisturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the frenchrevolution, the worst of which were the work of a usurping few, andwhich, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popularinstitutions, but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak againstmonarchical and aristocratic despotism end_token in time, however, a democraticrepublic came to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface, and madeitself felt as one of the most powerful members of the community ofnations; and elective and responsible government became subject to theobservations and criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact end_token itwas now perceived that such phrases as \"self-government,\" and \"the powerof the people over themselves,\" do not express the true state of thecase end_token the \"people\" who exercise the power are not always the same peoplewith those over whom it is exercised; and the \"self-government\" spokenof is not the government of each by himself, but of each by all therest end_token the will of the people, moreover, practically means, the will ofthe most numerous or the most active part of the people; the majority,or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: thepeople, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number;and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any otherabuse of power end_token the limitation, therefore, of the power of governmentover individuals, loses none of its importance when the holders of powerare regularly accountable to the community, that is, to the strongestparty therein end_token this view of things, recommending itself equally to theintelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those importantclasses in european society to whose real or supposed interestsdemocracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in establishing itself; andin political speculations \"the tyranny of the majority\" is now generallyincluded among the evils against which society requires to be on itsguard end_tokenlike other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority was at first, and isstill vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts ofthe public authorities end_token but reflecting persons perceived that whensociety is itself the tyrant--society collectively, over the separateindividuals who compose it--its means of tyrannising are not restrictedto the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries end_tokensociety can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrongmandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with whichit ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidablethan many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usuallyupheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape,penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving thesoul itself end_token protection, therefore, against the tyranny of themagistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against thetyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency ofsociety to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideasand practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; tofetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the formation, of anyindividuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters tofashion themselves upon the model of its own end_token there is a limit to thelegitimate interference of collective opinion with individualindependence: and to find that limit, and maintain it againstencroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs,as protection against political despotism end_tokenbut though this proposition is not likely to be contested in generalterms, the practical question, where to place the limit--how to make thefitting adjustment between individual independence and socialcontrol--is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done end_token allthat makes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement ofrestraints upon the actions of other people end_token some rules of conduct,therefore, must be imposed, by law in the first place, and by opinion onmany things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law end_token whatthese rules should be, is the principal question in human affairs; butif we except a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those whichleast progress has been made in resolving end_token no two ages, and scarcely anytwo countries, have decided it alike; and the decision of one age orcountry is a wonder to another end_token yet the people of any given age andcountry no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subjecton which mankind had always been agreed end_token the rules which obtain amongthemselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying end_token this all butuniversal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence ofcustom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a second nature, but iscontinually mistaken for the first end_token the effect of custom, in preventingany misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which mankind impose onone another, is all the more complete because the subject is one onwhich it is not generally considered necessary that reasons should begiven, either by one person to others, or by each to himself end_token people areaccustomed to believe, and have been encouraged in the belief by somewho aspire to the character of philosophers, that their feelings, onsubjects of this nature, are better than reasons, and render reasonsunnecessary end_token the practical principle which guides them to their opinionson the regulation of human conduct, is the feeling in each person's mindthat everybody should be required to act as he, and those with whom hesympathises, would like them to act end_token no one, indeed, acknowledges tohimself that his standard of judgment is his own liking; but an opinionon a point of conduct, not supported by reasons, can only count as oneperson's preference; and if the reasons, when given, are a mere appealto a similar preference felt by other people, it is still only manypeople's liking instead of one end_token to an ordinary man, however, his ownpreference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactoryreason, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions ofmorality, taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in hisreligious creed; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that end_tokenmen's opinions, accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, areaffected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes inregard to the conduct of others, and which are as numerous as thosewhich determine their wishes on any other subject end_token sometimes theirreason--at other times their prejudices or superstitions: often theirsocial affections, not seldom their anti-social ones, their envy orjealousy, their arrogance or contemptuousness: but most commonly, theirdesires or fears for themselves--their legitimate or illegitimateself-interest end_token wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion ofthe morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and itsfeelings of class superiority end_token the morality between spartans and helots,between planters and negroes, between princes and subjects, betweennobles and roturiers, between men and women, has been for the most partthe creation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentimentsthus generated, react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members ofthe ascendant class, in their relations among themselves end_token where, on theother hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, orwhere its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentimentsfrequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority end_tokenanother grand determining principle of the rules of conduct, both in actand forbearance, which have been enforced by law or opinion, has beenthe servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversionsof their temporal masters, or of their gods end_token this servility, thoughessentially selfish, is not hypocrisy; it gives rise to perfectlygenuine sentiments of abhorrence; it made men burn magicians andheretics end_token among so many baser influences, the general and obviousinterests of society have of course had a share, and a large one, in thedirection of the moral sentiments: less, however, as a matter of reason,and on their own account, than as a consequence of the sympathies andantipathies which grew out of them: and sympathies and antipathies whichhad little or nothing to do with the interests of society, have madethemselves felt in the establishment of moralities with quite as greatforce end_tokenthe likings and dislikings of society, or of some powerful portion ofit, are thus the main thing which has practically determined the ruleslaid down for general observance, under the penalties of law oropinion end_token and in general, those who have been in advance of society inthought and feeling have left this condition of things unassailed inprinciple, however they may have come into conflict with it in some ofits details end_token they have occupied themselves rather in inquiring whatthings society ought to like or dislike, than in questioning whether itslikings or dislikings should be a law to individuals end_token they preferredendeavouring to alter the feelings of mankind on the particular pointson which they were themselves heretical, rather than make common causein defence of freedom, with heretics generally end_token the only case in whichthe higher ground has been taken on principle and maintained withconsistency, by any but an individual here and there, is that ofreligious belief: a case instructive in many ways, and not least so asforming a most striking instance of the fallibility of what is calledthe moral sense: for the odium theologicum, in a sincere bigot, is oneof the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling end_token those who first brokethe yoke of what called itself the universal church, were in general aslittle willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that churchitself end_token but when the heat of the conflict was over, without giving acomplete victory to any party, and each church or sect was reduced tolimit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it alreadyoccupied; minorities, seeing that they had no chance of becomingmajorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those whom theycould not convert, for permission to differ end_token it is accordingly on thisbattle-field, almost solely, that the rights of the individual againstsociety have been asserted on broad grounds of principle, and the claimof society to exercise authority over dissentients, openly controverted end_tokenthe great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty itpossesses, have mostly asserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasibleright, and denied absolutely that a human being is accountable to othersfor his religious belief end_token yet so natural to mankind is intolerance inwhatever they really care about, that religious freedom has hardlyanywhere been practically realised, except where religious indifference,which dislikes to have its peace disturbed by theological quarrels, hasadded its weight to the scale end_token in the minds of almost all religiouspersons, even in the most tolerant countries, the duty of toleration isadmitted with tacit reserves end_token one person will bear with dissent inmatters of church government, but not of dogma; another can tolerateeverybody, short of a papist or a unitarian; another, every one whobelieves in revealed religion; a few extend their charity a littlefurther, but stop at the belief in a god and in a future state end_token whereverthe sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense, it is foundto have abated little of its claim to be obeyed end_tokenin england, from the peculiar circumstances of our political history,though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier, that of law is lighter,than in most other countries of europe; and there is considerablejealousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executivepower, with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for theindependence of the individual, as from the still subsisting habit oflooking on the government as representing an opposite interest to thepublic end_token the majority have not yet learnt to feel the power of thegovernment their power, or its opinions their opinions end_token when they do so,individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from thegovernment, as it already is from public opinion end_token but, as yet, there isa considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against anyattempt of the law to control individuals in things in which they havenot hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it; and this with verylittle discrimination as to whether the matter is, or is not, within thelegitimate sphere of legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highlysalutary on the whole, is perhaps quite as often misplaced as wellgrounded in the particular instances of its application end_token there is, infact, no recognised principle by which the propriety or impropriety ofgovernment interference is customarily tested end_token people decide accordingto their personal preferences end_token some, whenever they see any good to bedone, or evil to be remedied, would willingly instigate the governmentto undertake the business; while others prefer to bear almost any amountof social evil, rather than add one to the departments of humaninterests amenable to governmental control end_token and men range themselves onone or the other side in any particular case, according to this generaldirection of their sentiments; or according to the degree of interestwhich they feel in the particular thing which it is proposed that thegovernment should do, or according to the belief they entertain that thegovernment would, or would not, do it in the manner they prefer; butvery rarely on account of any opinion to which they consistently adhere,as to what things are fit to be done by a government end_token and it seems to methat in consequence of this absence of rule or principle, one side isat present as often wrong as the other; the interference of governmentis, with about equal frequency, improperly invoked and improperlycondemned end_tokenthe object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, asentitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with theindividual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means usedbe physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercionof public opinion end_token that principle is, that the sole end for whichmankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering withthe liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection end_token thatthe only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over anymember of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm toothers end_token his own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficientwarrant end_token he cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because itwill be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier,because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or evenright end_token these are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoningwith him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compellinghim, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise end_token to justifythat, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must becalculated to produce evil to some one else end_token the only part of theconduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that whichconcerns others end_token in the part which merely concerns himself, hisindependence is, of right, absolute end_token over himself, over his own body andmind, the individual is sovereign end_tokenit is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant toapply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties end_token we arenot speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which thelaw may fix as that of manhood or womanhood end_token those who are still in astate to require being taken care of by others, must be protectedagainst their own actions as well as against external injury end_token for thesame reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states ofsociety in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage end_token theearly difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, thatthere is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a rulerfull of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of anyexpedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable end_tokendespotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing withbarbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the meansjustified by actually effecting that end end_token liberty, as a principle, hasno application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankindhave become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion end_tokenuntil then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an akbaror a charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one end_token but as soonas mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their ownimprovement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached inall nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion,either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties fornon-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own good,and justifiable only for the security of others end_tokenit is proper to state that i forego any advantage which could be derivedto my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing independentof utility end_token i regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethicalquestions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on thepermanent interests of man as a progressive being end_token those interests, icontend, authorise the subjection of individual spontaneity to externalcontrol, only in respect to those actions of each, which concern theinterest of other people end_token if any one does an act hurtful to others,there is a primã¢ facie case for punishing him, by law, or, where legalpenalties are not safely applicable, by general disapprobation end_token thereare also many positive acts for the benefit of others, which he mayrightfully be compelled to perform;

to make him answerablefor not preventing evil, is, comparatively speaking, the exception end_token yetthere are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify thatexception end_token in all things which regard the external relations of theindividual, he is de jure amenable to those whose interests areconcerned, and if need be, to society as their protector end_token there areoften good reasons for not holding him to the responsibility; but thesereasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case: eitherbecause it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to actbetter, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled in any wayin which society have it in their power to control him; or because theattempt to exercise control would produce other evils, greater thanthose which it would prevent end_token when such reasons as these preclude theenforcement of responsibility, the conscience of the agent himselfshould step into the vacant judgment seat, and protect those interestsof others which have no external protection;

and the objection which may begrounded on this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel end_tokenthis, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty end_token it comprises,first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty ofconscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought andfeeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects,practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological end_token the libertyof expressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a differentprinciple, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individualwhich concerns other people; but, being almost of as much importance asthe liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the samereasons, is practically inseparable from it end_token secondly, the principlerequires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our lifeto suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to suchconsequences as may follow: without impediment from ourfellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even thoughthey should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong end_token thirdly, fromthis liberty of each individual, follows the liberty, within the samelimits, of combination among individuals; freedom to unite, for anypurpose not involving harm to others: the persons combining beingsupposed to be of full age, and not forced or deceived end_tokenno society in which these liberties are not, on the whole, respected, isfree, whatever may be its form of government; and none is completelyfree in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified end_token the onlyfreedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in ourown way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, orimpede their efforts to obtain it end_token each is the proper guardian of hisown health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual end_token mankind are greatergainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves,than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest end_tokenthough this doctrine is anything but new, and, to some persons, may havethe air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands more directlyopposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and practice end_tokensociety has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according toits lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal, asof social excellence end_token the ancient commonwealths thought themselvesentitled to practise, and the ancient philosophers countenanced, theregulation of every part of private conduct by public authority, on theground that the state had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mentaldiscipline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which mayhave been admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies,in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internalcommotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy andself-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford towait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom end_token in the modern world,the greater size of political communities, and above all, the separationbetween spiritual and temporal authority (which placed the direction ofmen's consciences in other hands than those which controlled theirworldly affairs), prevented so great an interference by law in thedetails of private life; but the engines of moral repression have beenwielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion inself-regarding, than even in social matters; religion, the most powerfulof the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling,having almost always been governed either by the ambition of ahierarchy, seeking control over every department of human conduct, or bythe spirit of puritanism end_token and some of those modern reformers who haveplaced themselves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past,have been noway behind either churches or sects in their assertion ofthe right of spiritual domination: m end_token comte, in particular, whose socialsystem, as unfolded in his traitã© de politique positive, aims atestablishing (though by moral more than by legal appliances) a despotismof society over the individual, surpassing anything contemplated in thepolitical ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancientphilosophers end_tokenapart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers, there is also inthe world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly thepowers of society over the individual, both by the force of opinion andeven by that of legislation: and as the tendency of all the changestaking place in the world is to strengthen society, and diminish thepower of the individual, this encroachment is not one of the evils whichtend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more andmore formidable end_token the disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or asfellow-citizens to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a ruleof conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the bestand by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it ishardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of power; and asthe power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier ofmoral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, inthe present circumstances of the world, to see it increase end_tokenit will be convenient for the argument, if, instead of at once enteringupon the general thesis, we confine ourselves in the first instance to asingle branch of it, on which the principle here stated is, if notfully, yet to a certain point, recognised by the current opinions end_token thisone branch is the liberty of thought: from which it is impossible toseparate the cognate liberty of speaking and of writing end_token although theseliberties, to some considerable amount, form part of the politicalmorality of all countries which profess religious toleration and freeinstitutions, the grounds, both philosophical and practical, on whichthey rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the general mind, nor sothoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion, as mighthave been expected end_token those grounds, when rightly understood, are of muchwider application than to only one division of the subject, and athorough consideration of this part of the question will be found thebest introduction to the remainder end_token those to whom nothing which i amabout to say will be new, may therefore, i hope, excuse me, if on asubject which for now three centuries has been so often discussed, iventure on one discussion more end_tokenof the liberty of thought and discussion end_tokenthe time, it is to be hoped, is gone by, when any defence would benecessary of the \"liberty of the press\" as one of the securities againstcorrupt or tyrannical government end_token no argument, we may suppose, can nowbe needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, notidentified in interest with the people, to prescribe opinions to them,and determine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed tohear end_token this aspect of the question, besides, has been so often and sotriumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it need not bespecially insisted on in this place end_token though the law of england, on thesubject of the press, is as servile to this day as it was in the time ofthe tudors, there is little danger of its being actually put in forceagainst political discussion, except during some temporary panic, whenfear of insurrection drives ministers and judges from theirpropriety; and, speaking generally, it is not, in constitutionalcountries, to be apprehended that the government, whether completelyresponsible to the people or not, will often attempt to control theexpression of opinion, except when in doing so it makes itself the organof the general intolerance of the public end_token let us suppose, therefore,that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinksof exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what itconceives to be their voice end_token but i deny the right of the people toexercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government end_token thepower itself is illegitimate end_token the best government has no more title toit than the worst end_token it is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted inaccordance with public opinion, than when in or opposition to it end_token if allmankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of thecontrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing thatone person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified insilencing mankind end_token were an opinion a personal possession of no valueexcept to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it weresimply a private injury, it would make some difference whether theinjury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many end_token but the peculiarevil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbingthe human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those whodissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it end_token if theopinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchangingerror for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit,the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by itscollision with error end_tokenit is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each ofwhich has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it end_token we cannever be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a falseopinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still end_tokenfirst: the opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority maypossibly be true end_token those who desire to suppress it, of course deny itstruth; but they are not infallible end_token they have no authority to decide thequestion for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the meansof judging end_token to refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are surethat it is false, is to assume that their certainty is the same thingas absolute certainty end_token all silencing of discussion is an assumptionof infallibility end_token its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this commonargument, not the worse for being common end_tokenunfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of theirfallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment,which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knowshimself to be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautionsagainst their own fallibility, or admit the supposition that anyopinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples ofthe error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable end_token absoluteprinces, or others who are accustomed to unlimited deference, usuallyfeel this complete confidence in their own opinions on nearly allsubjects end_token people more happily situated, who sometimes hear theiropinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be set right when theyare wrong, place the same unbounded reliance only on such of theiropinions as are shared by all who surround them, or to whom theyhabitually defer: for in proportion to a man's want of confidence in hisown solitary judgment, does he usually repose, with implicit trust, onthe infallibility of \"the world\" in general end_token and the world, to eachindividual, means the part of it with which he comes in contact; hisparty, his sect, his church, his class of society: the man may becalled, by comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it meansanything so comprehensive as his own country or his own age end_token nor is hisfaith in this collective authority at all shaken by his being aware thatother ages, countries, sects, churches, classes, and parties havethought, and even now think, the exact reverse end_token he devolves upon his ownworld the responsibility of being in the right against the dissentientworlds of other people; and it never troubles him that mere accident hasdecided which of these numerous worlds is the object of his reliance,and that the same causes which make him a churchman in london, wouldhave made him a buddhist or a confucian in pekin end_token yet it is as evidentin itself as any amount of argument can make it, that ages are no moreinfallible than individuals; every age having held many opinions whichsubsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd; and it is ascertain that many opinions, now general, will be rejected by futureages, as it is that many, once general, are rejected by the present end_tokenthe objection likely to be made to this argument, would probably takesome such form as the following end_token there is no greater assumption ofinfallibility in forbidding the propagation of error, than in any otherthing which is done by public authority on its own judgment andresponsibility end_token judgment is given to men that they may use it end_token becauseit may be used erroneously, are men to be told that they ought not touse it at all? to prohibit what they think pernicious, is not claimingexemption from error, but fulfilling the duty incumbent on them,although fallible, of acting on their conscientious conviction end_token if wewere never to act on our opinions, because those opinions may be wrong,we should leave all our interests uncared for, and all our dutiesunperformed end_token an objection which applies to all conduct, can be no validobjection to any conduct in particular end_token it is the duty of governments,and of individuals, to form the truest opinions they can; to form themcarefully, and never impose them upon others unless they are quite sureof being right end_token but when they are sure (such reasoners may say), it isnot conscientiousness but cowardice to shrink from acting on theiropinions, and allow doctrines which they honestly think dangerous to thewelfare of mankind, either in this life or in another, to be scatteredabroad without restraint, because other people, in less enlightenedtimes, have persecuted opinions now believed to be true end_token let us takecare, it may be said, not to make the same mistake: but governments andnations have made mistakes in other things, which are not denied to befit subjects for the exercise of authority: they have laid on bad taxes,made unjust wars end_token ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and, underwhatever provocation, make no wars? men, and governments, must act tothe best of their ability end_token there is no such thing as absolute certainty,but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of human life end_token wemay, and must, assume our opinion to be true for the guidance of our ownconduct: and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad men to pervertsociety by the propagation of opinions which we regard as false andpernicious end_tokeni answer that it is assuming very much more end_token there is the greatestdifference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with everyopportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming itstruth for the purpose of not permitting its refutation end_token complete libertyof contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the very condition whichjustifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action; and on noother terms can a being with human faculties have any rational assuranceof being right end_tokenwhen we consider either the history of opinion, or the ordinary conductof human life, to what is it to be ascribed that the one and the otherare no worse than they are? not certainly to the inherent force of thehuman understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there areninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of it, for one who iscapable; and the capacity of the hundredth person is only comparative;for the majority of the eminent men of every past generation held manyopinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerous thingswhich no one will now justify end_token why is it, then, that there is on thewhole a preponderance among mankind of rational opinions and rationalconduct? if there really is this preponderance--which there must be,unless human affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperatestate--it is owing to a quality of the human mind, the source ofeverything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moralbeing, namely, that his errors are corrigible end_token he is capable ofrectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience end_token not by experiencealone end_token there must be discussion, to show how experience is to beinterpreted end_token wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact andargument: but facts and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind,must be brought before it end_token very few facts are able to tell their ownstory, without comments to bring out their meaning end_token the whole strengthand value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one property, thatit can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it onlywhen the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand end_token in thecase of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, howhas it become so? because he has kept his mind open to criticism of hisopinions and conduct end_token because it has been his practice to listen to allthat could be said against him; to profit by as much of it as was just,and expound to himself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of whatwas fallacious end_token because he has felt, that the only way in which a humanbeing can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is byhearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety ofopinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by everycharacter of mind end_token no wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode butthis; nor is it in the nature of human intellect to become wise in anyother manner end_token the steady habit of correcting and completing his ownopinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubtand hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stablefoundation for a just reliance on it: for, being cognisant of all thatcan, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up hisposition against all gainsayers--knowing that he has sought forobjections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut outno light which can be thrown upon the subject from any quarter--he has aright to think his judgment better than that of any person, or anymultitude, who have not gone through a similar process end_tokenit is not too much to require that what the wisest of mankind, those whoare best entitled to trust their own judgment, find necessary to warranttheir relying on it, should be submitted to by that miscellaneouscollection of a few wise and many foolish individuals, called thepublic end_token the most intolerant of churches, the roman catholic church, evenat the canonisation of a saint, admits, and listens patiently to, a\"devil's advocate end_token\" the holiest of men, it appears, cannot be admittedto posthumous honours, until all that the devil could say against him isknown and weighed end_token if even the newtonian philosophy were not permittedto be questioned, mankind could not feel as complete assurance of itstruth as they now do end_token the beliefs which we have most warrant for, haveno safeguard to rest on, but a standing invitation to the whole world toprove them unfounded end_token if the challenge is not accepted, or is acceptedand the attempt fails, we are far enough from certainty still; but wehave done the best that the existing state of human reason admits of; wehave neglected nothing that could give the truth a chance of reachingus: if the lists are kept open, we may hope that if there be a bettertruth, it will be found when the human mind is capable of receiving it;and in the meantime we may rely on having attained such approach totruth, as is possible in our own day end_token this is the amount of certaintyattainable by a fallible being, and this the sole way of attaining it end_tokenstrange it is, that men should admit the validity of the arguments forfree discussion, but object to their being \"pushed to an extreme;\" notseeing that unless the reasons are good for an extreme case, they arenot good for any case end_token strange that they should imagine that they arenot assuming infallibility, when they acknowledge that there should befree discussion on all subjects which can possibly be _doubtful_, butthink that some particular principle or doctrine should be forbidden tobe questioned because it is _so certain_, that is, because _they arecertain_ that it is certain end_token to call any proposition certain, whilethere is any one who would deny its certainty if permitted, but who isnot permitted, is to assume that we ourselves, and those who agree withus, are the judges of certainty, and judges without hearing the otherside end_tokenin the present age--which has been described as \"destitute of faith, butterrified at scepticism\"--in which people feel sure, not so much thattheir opinions are true, as that they should not know what to do withoutthem--the claims of an opinion to be protected from public attack arerested not so much on its truth, as on its importance to society end_token thereare, it is alleged, certain beliefs, so useful, not to say indispensableto well-being, that it is as much the duty of governments to upholdthose beliefs, as to protect any other of the interests of society end_token in acase of such necessity, and so directly in the line of their duty,something less than infallibility may, it is maintained, warrant, andeven bind, governments, to act on their own opinion, confirmed by thegeneral opinion of mankind end_token it is also often argued, and still oftenerthought, that none but bad men would desire to weaken these salutarybeliefs; and there can be nothing wrong, it is thought, in restrainingbad men, and prohibiting what only such men would wish to practise end_tokenthis mode of thinking makes the justification of restraints ondiscussion not a question of the truth of doctrines, but of theirusefulness; and flatters itself by that means to escape theresponsibility of claiming to be an infallible judge of opinions end_token butthose who thus satisfy themselves, do not perceive that the assumptionof infallibility is merely shifted from one point to another end_token theusefulness of an opinion is itself matter of opinion: as disputable, asopen to discussion, and requiring discussion as much, as the opinionitself end_token there is the same need of an infallible judge of opinions todecide an opinion to be noxious, as to decide it to be false, unless theopinion condemned has full opportunity of defending itself end_token and it willnot do to say that the heretic may be allowed to maintain the utility orharmlessness of his opinion, though forbidden to maintain its truth end_token thetruth of an opinion is part of its utility end_token if we would know whether ornot it is desirable that a proposition should be believed, is itpossible to exclude the consideration of whether or not it is true? inthe opinion, not of bad men, but of the best men, no belief which iscontrary to truth can be really useful: and can you prevent such menfrom urging that plea, when they are charged with culpability fordenying some doctrine which they are told is useful, but which theybelieve to be false? those who are on the side of received opinions,never fail to take all possible advantage of this plea; you do not findthem handling the question of utility as if it could be completelyabstracted from that of truth: on the contrary, it is, above all,because their doctrine is \"the truth,\" that the knowledge or the beliefof it is held to be so indispensable end_token there can be no fair discussion ofthe question of usefulness, when an argument so vital may be employed onone side, but not on the other end_token and in point of fact, when law or publicfeeling do not permit the truth of an opinion to be disputed, they arejust as little tolerant of a denial of its usefulness end_token the utmost theyallow is an extenuation of its absolute necessity, or of the positiveguilt of rejecting it end_tokenin order more fully to illustrate the mischief of denying a hearing toopinions because we, in our own judgment, have condemned them, it willbe desirable to fix down the discussion to a concrete case; and ichoose, by preference, the cases which are least favourable to me--inwhich the argument against freedom of opinion, both on the score oftruth and on that of utility, is considered the strongest end_token let theopinions impugned be the belief in a god and in a future state, or anyof the commonly received doctrines of morality end_token to fight the battle onsuch ground, gives a great advantage to an unfair antagonist; since hewill be sure to say (and many who have no desire to be unfair will sayit internally), are these the doctrines which you do not deemsufficiently certain to be taken under the protection of law? is thebelief in a god one of the opinions, to feel sure of which, you hold tobe assuming infallibility? but i must be permitted to observe, that itis not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which i callan assumption of infallibility end_token it is the undertaking to decide thatquestion _for others_, without allowing them to hear what can be said onthe contrary side end_token and i denounce and reprobate this pretension not theless, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions end_token howeverpositive any one's persuasion may be, not only of the falsity, but ofthe pernicious consequences--not only of the pernicious consequences,but (to adopt expressions which i altogether condemn) the immorality andimpiety of an opinion; yet if, in pursuance of that private judgment,though backed by the public judgment of his country or hiscontemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence,he assumes infallibility end_token and so far from the assumption being lessobjectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral orimpious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal end_token theseare exactly the occasions on which the men of one generation committhose dreadful mistakes, which excite the astonishment and horror ofposterity end_token it is among such that we find the instances memorable inhistory, when the arm of the law has been employed to root out the bestmen and the noblest doctrines; with deplorable success as to the men,though some of the doctrines have survived to be (as if in mockery)invoked, in defence of similar conduct towards those who dissent from_them_, or from their received interpretation end_tokenmankind can hardly be too often reminded that there was once a man namedsocrates, between whom and the legal authorities and public opinion ofhis time, there took place a memorable collision end_token born in an age andcountry abounding in individual greatness, this man has been handed downto us by those who best knew both him and the age, as the most virtuousman in it;

inasmuch as this strangehistory of a crucified god was not credible to him, and a system whichpurported to rest entirely upon a foundation to him so whollyunbelievable, could not be foreseen by him to be that renovating agencywhich, after all abatements, it has in fact proved to be; the gentlestand most amiable of philosophers and rulers, under a solemn sense ofduty, authorised the persecution of christianity end_token to my mind this is oneof the most tragical facts in all history end_token it is a bitter thought, howdifferent a thing the christianity of the world might have been, if thechristian faith had been adopted as the religion of the empire under theauspices of marcus aurelius instead of those of constantine end_token but itwould be equally unjust to him and false to truth, to deny, that no oneplea which can be urged for punishing anti-christian teaching, waswanting to marcus aurelius for punishing, as he did, the propagation ofchristianity end_token no christian more firmly believes that atheism is false,and tends to the dissolution of society, than marcus aurelius believedthe same things of christianity;

that their reward should be to be dealt with asthe vilest of criminals, is not, upon this theory, a deplorable errorand misfortune, for which humanity should mourn in sackcloth and ashes,but the normal and justifiable state of things end_token the propounder of a newtruth, according to this doctrine, should stand, as stood, in thelegislation of the locrians, the proposer of a new law, with a halterround his neck, to be instantly tightened if the public assembly didnot, on hearing his reasons, then and there adopt his proposition end_tokenpeople who defend this mode of treating benefactors, cannot be supposedto set much value on the benefit; and i believe this view of the subjectis mostly confined to the sort of persons who think that new truths mayhave been desirable once, but that we have had enough of them now end_tokenbut, indeed, the dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution, isone of those pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one anothertill they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes end_tokenhistory teems with instances of truth put down by persecution end_token if notsuppressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries end_token to speak onlyof religious opinions: the reformation broke out at least twenty timesbefore luther, and was put down end_token arnold of brescia was put down end_token fradolcino was put down end_token savonarola was put down end_token the albigeois were putdown end_token the vaudois were put down end_token the lollards were put down end_token thehussites were put down end_token even after the era of luther, whereverpersecution was persisted in, it was successful end_token in spain, italy,flanders, the austrian empire, protestantism was rooted out; and, mostlikely, would have been so in england, had queen mary lived, or queenelizabeth died end_token persecution has always succeeded, save where theheretics were too strong a party to be effectually persecuted end_token noreasonable person can doubt that christianity might have been extirpatedin the roman empire end_token it spread, and became predominant, because thepersecutions were only occasional, lasting but a short time, andseparated by long intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism end_token it is apiece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has anyinherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon andthe stake end_token men are not more zealous for truth than they often are forerror, and a sufficient application of legal or even of social penaltieswill generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either end_token the realadvantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion istrue, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in thecourse of ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it,until some one of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourablecircumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as towithstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it end_tokenit will be said, that we do not now put to death the introducers of newopinions: we are not like our fathers who slew the prophets, we evenbuild sepulchres to them end_token it is true we no longer put heretics to death;and the amount of penal infliction which modern feeling would probablytolerate, even against the most obnoxious opinions, is not sufficient toextirpate them end_token but let us not flatter ourselves that we are yet freefrom the stain even of legal persecution end_token penalties for opinion, or atleast for its expression, still exist by law; and their enforcement isnot, even in these times, so unexampled as to make it at all incrediblethat they may some day be revived in full force end_token in the year 1857, atthe summer assizes of the county of cornwall, an unfortunate man,said to be of unexceptionable conduct in all relations of life, wassentenced to twenty-one months' imprisonment, for uttering, and writingon a gate, some offensive words concerning christianity end_token within a monthof the same time, at the old bailey, two persons, on two separateoccasions, were rejected as jurymen, and one of them grossly insultedby the judge and by one of the counsel, because they honestly declaredthat they had no theological belief; and a third, a foreigner, forthe same reason, was denied justice against a thief end_token this refusal ofredress took place in virtue of the legal doctrine, that no person canbe allowed to give evidence in a court of justice, who does not professbelief in a god (any god is sufficient) and in a future state; which isequivalent to declaring such persons to be outlaws, excluded from theprotection of the tribunals; who may not only be robbed or assaultedwith impunity, if no one but themselves, or persons of similar opinions,be present, but any one else may be robbed or assaulted with impunity,if the proof of the fact depends on their evidence end_token the assumption onwhich this is grounded, is that the oath is worthless, of a person whodoes not believe in a future state; a proposition which betokens muchignorance of history in those who assent to it (since it is historicallytrue that a large proportion of infidels in all ages have been personsof distinguished integrity and honour); and would be maintained by noone who had the smallest conception how many of the persons in greatestrepute with the world, both for virtues and for attainments, are wellknown, at least to their intimates, to be unbelievers end_token the rule,besides, is suicidal, and cuts away its own foundation end_token under pretencethat atheists must be liars, it admits the testimony of all atheists whoare willing to lie, and rejects only those who brave the obloquy ofpublicly confessing a detested creed rather than affirm a falsehood end_token arule thus self-convicted of absurdity so far as regards its professedpurpose, can be kept in force only as a badge of hatred, a relic ofpersecution; a persecution, too, having the peculiarity, that thequalification for undergoing it, is the being clearly proved not todeserve it end_token the rule, and the theory it implies, are hardly lessinsulting to believers than to infidels end_token for if he who does not believein a future state, necessarily lies, it follows that they who do believeare only prevented from lying, if prevented they are, by the fear ofhell end_token we will not do the authors and abettors of the rule the injury ofsupposing, that the conception which they have formed of christianvirtue is drawn from their own consciousness end_tokenthese, indeed, are but rags and remnants of persecution, and may bethought to be not so much an indication of the wish to persecute, as anexample of that very frequent infirmity of english minds, which makesthem take a preposterous pleasure in the assertion of a bad principle,when they are no longer bad enough to desire to carry it really intopractice end_token but unhappily there is no security in the state of the publicmind, that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution, which haslasted for about the space of a generation, will continue end_token in this agethe quiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts toresuscitate past evils, as to introduce new benefits end_token what is boasted ofat the present time as the revival of religion, is always, in narrowand uncultivated minds, at least as much the revival of bigotry; andwhere there is the strong permanent leaven of intolerance in thefeelings of a people, which at all times abides in the middle classes ofthis country, it needs but little to provoke them into activelypersecuting those whom they have never ceased to think proper objects ofpersecution end_token for it is this--it is the opinions men entertain, andthe feelings they cherish, respecting those who disown the beliefs theydeem important, which makes this country not a place of mental freedom end_tokenfor a long time past, the chief mischief of the legal penalties is thatthey strengthen the social stigma end_token it is that stigma which is reallyeffective, and so effective is it that the profession of opinions whichare under the ban of society is much less common in england, than is, inmany other countries, the avowal of those which incur risk of judicialpunishment end_token in respect to all persons but those whose pecuniarycircumstances make them independent of the good will of other people,opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law; men might as well beimprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread end_token thosewhose bread is already secured, and who desire no favours from men inpower, or from bodies of men, or from the public, have nothing to fearfrom the open avowal of any opinions, but to be ill-thought of andill-spoken of, and this it ought not to require a very heroic mould toenable them to bear end_token there is no room for any appeal _ad misericordiam_in behalf of such persons end_token but though we do not now inflict so much evilon those who think differently from us, as it was formerly our custom todo, it may be that we do ourselves as much evil as ever by our treatmentof them end_token socrates was put to death, but the socratic philosophy roselike the sun in heaven, and spread its illumination over the wholeintellectual firmament end_token christians were cast to the lions, but thechristian church grew up a stately and spreading tree, overtopping theolder and less vigorous growths, and stifling them by its shade end_token ourmerely social intolerance kills no one, roots out no opinions, butinduces men to disguise them, or to abstain from any active effort fortheir diffusion end_token with us, heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain, oreven lose, ground in each decade or generation; they never blaze out farand wide, but continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking andstudious persons among whom they originate, without ever lighting up thegeneral affairs of mankind with either a true or a deceptive light end_token andthus is kept up a state of things very satisfactory to some minds,because, without the unpleasant process of fining or imprisoninganybody, it maintains all prevailing opinions outwardly undisturbed,while it does not absolutely interdict the exercise of reason bydissentients afflicted with the malady of thought end_token a convenient plan forhaving peace in the intellectual world, and keeping all things going ontherein very much as they do already end_token but the price paid for this sortof intellectual pacification, is the sacrifice of the entire moralcourage of the human mind end_token a state of things in which a large portion ofthe most active and inquiring intellects find it advisable to keep thegenuine principles and grounds of their convictions within their ownbreasts, and attempt, in what they address to the public, to fit as muchas they can of their own conclusions to premises which they haveinternally renounced, cannot send forth the open, fearless characters,and logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the thinking world end_tokenthe sort of men who can be looked for under it, are either mereconformers to commonplace, or time-servers for truth, whose arguments onall great subjects are meant for their hearers, and are not those whichhave convinced themselves end_token those who avoid this alternative, do so bynarrowing their thoughts and interest to things which can be spoken ofwithout venturing within the region of principles, that is, to smallpractical matters, which would come right of themselves, if but theminds of mankind were strengthened and enlarged, and which will never bemade effectually right until then: while that which would strengthen andenlarge men's minds, free and daring speculation on the highestsubjects, is abandoned end_tokenthose in whose eyes this reticence on the part of heretics is no evil,should consider in the first place, that in consequence of it there isnever any fair and thorough discussion of heretical opinions; and thatsuch of them as could not stand such a discussion, though they may beprevented from spreading, do not disappear end_token but it is not the minds ofheretics that are deteriorated most, by the ban placed on all inquirywhich does not end in the orthodox conclusions end_token the greatest harm doneis to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental development iscramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy end_token who can computewhat the world loses in the multitude of promising intellects combinedwith timid characters, who dare not follow out any bold, vigorous,independent train of thought, lest it should land them in somethingwhich would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral? amongthem we may occasionally see some man of deep conscientiousness, andsubtle and refined understanding, who spends a life in sophisticatingwith an intellect which he cannot silence, and exhausts the resources ofingenuity in attempting to reconcile the promptings of his conscienceand reason with orthodoxy, which yet he does not, perhaps, to the endsucceed in doing end_token no one can be a great thinker who does not recognise,that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect towhatever conclusions it may lead end_token truth gains more even by the errors ofone who, with due study and preparation, thinks for himself, than by thetrue opinions of those who only hold them because they do not sufferthemselves to think end_token not that it is solely, or chiefly, to form greatthinkers, that freedom of thinking is required end_token on the contrary, it isas much, and even more indispensable, to enable average human beings toattain the mental stature which they are capable of end_token there have been,and may again be, great individual thinkers, in a general atmosphere ofmental slavery end_token but there never has been, nor ever will be, in thatatmosphere, an intellectually active people end_token where any people has made atemporary approach to such a character, it has been because the dreadof heterodox speculation was for a time suspended end_token where there is atacit convention that principles are not to be disputed; where thediscussion of the greatest questions which can occupy humanity isconsidered to be closed, we cannot hope to find that generally highscale of mental activity which has made some periods of history soremarkable end_token never when controversy avoided the subjects which are largeand important enough to kindle enthusiasm, was the mind of a peoplestirred up from its foundations, and the impulse given which raised evenpersons of the most ordinary intellect to something of the dignity ofthinking beings end_token of such we have had an example in the condition ofeurope during the times immediately following the reformation; another,though limited to the continent and to a more cultivated class, in thespeculative movement of the latter half of the eighteenth century; and athird, of still briefer duration, in the intellectual fermentation ofgermany during the goethian and fichtean period end_token these periods differedwidely in the particular opinions which they developed; but were alikein this, that during all three the yoke of authority was broken end_token ineach, an old mental despotism had been thrown off, and no new one hadyet taken its place end_token the impulse given at these three periods has madeeurope what it now is end_token every single improvement which has taken placeeither in the human mind or in institutions, may be traced distinctly toone or other of them end_token appearances have for some time indicated that allthree impulses are well-nigh spent; and we can expect no fresh start,until we again assert our mental freedom end_tokenlet us now pass to the second division of the argument, and dismissingthe supposition that any of the received opinions may be false, let usassume them to be true, and examine into the worth of the manner inwhich they are likely to be held, when their truth is not freely andopenly canvassed end_token however unwillingly a person who has a strong opinionmay admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to bemoved by the consideration that however true it may be, if it is notfully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a deaddogma, not a living truth end_tokenthere is a class of persons (happily not quite so numerous as formerly)who think it enough if a person assents undoubtingly to what they thinktrue, though he has no knowledge whatever of the grounds of the opinion,and could not make a tenable defence of it against the most superficialobjections end_token such persons, if they can once get their creed taught fromauthority, naturally think that no good, and some harm, comes of itsbeing allowed to be questioned end_token where their influence prevails, theymake it nearly impossible for the received opinion to be rejected wiselyand considerately, though it may still be rejected rashly andignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible, andwhen it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to giveway before the slightest semblance of an argument end_token waiving, however,this possibility--assuming that the true opinion abides in the mind, butabides as a prejudice, a belief independent of, and proof against,argument--this is not the way in which truth ought to be held by arational being end_token this is not knowing the truth end_token truth, thus held, is butone superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words whichenunciate a truth end_tokenif the intellect and judgment of mankind ought to be cultivated, a thingwhich protestants at least do not deny, on what can these faculties bemore appropriately exercised by any one, than on the things whichconcern him so much that it is considered necessary for him to holdopinions on them? if the cultivation of the understanding consists inone thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds ofone's own opinions end_token whatever people believe, on subjects on which it isof the first importance to believe rightly, they ought to be able todefend against at least the common objections end_token but, some one may say,\"let them be taught the grounds of their opinions end_token it does not followthat opinions must be merely parroted because they are never heardcontroverted end_token persons who learn geometry do not simply commit thetheorems to memory, but understand and learn likewise thedemonstrations;

some geocentric theory insteadof heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxygen; and it has to beshown why that other theory cannot be the true one: and until this isshown, and until we know how it is shown, we do not understand thegrounds of our opinion end_token but when we turn to subjects infinitely morecomplicated, to morals, religion, politics, social relations, and thebusiness of life, three-fourths of the arguments for every disputedopinion consist in dispelling the appearances which favour some opiniondifferent from it end_token the greatest orator, save one, of antiquity, has leftit on record that he always studied his adversary's case with as great,if not with still greater, intensity than even his own end_token what ciceropractised as the means of forensic success, requires to be imitated byall who study any subject in order to arrive at the truth end_token he who knowsonly his own side of the case, knows little of that end_token his reasons may begood, and no one may have been able to refute them end_token but if he is equallyunable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not somuch as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring eitheropinion end_token the rational position for him would be suspension of judgment,and unless he contents himself with that, he is either led byauthority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side towhich he feels most inclination end_token nor is it enough that he should hearthe arguments of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as theystate them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations end_token that isnot the way to do justice to the arguments, or bring them into realcontact with his own mind end_token he must be able to hear them from persons whoactually believe them; who defend them in earnest, and do their veryutmost for them end_token he must know them in their most plausible andpersuasive form; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty whichthe true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of; else hewill never really possess himself of the portion of truth which meetsand removes that difficulty end_token ninety-nine in a hundred of what are callededucated men are in this condition; even of those who can argue fluentlyfor their opinions end_token their conclusion may be true, but it might be falsefor anything they know: they have never thrown themselves into themental position of those who think differently from them, and consideredwhat such persons may have to say; and consequently they do not, in anyproper sense of the word, know the doctrine which they themselvesprofess end_token they do not know those parts of it which explain and justifythe remainder; the considerations which show that a fact which seeminglyconflicts with another is reconcilable with it, or that, of twoapparently strong reasons, one and not the other ought to be preferred end_tokenall that part of the truth which turns the scale, and decides thejudgment of a completely informed mind, they are strangers to; nor is itever really known, but to those who have attended equally andimpartially to both sides, and endeavoured to see the reasons of both inthe strongest light end_token so essential is this discipline to a realunderstanding of moral and human subjects, that if opponents of allimportant truths do not exist, it is indispensable to imagine them, andsupply them with the strongest arguments which the most skilful devil'sadvocate can conjure up end_tokento abate the force of these considerations, an enemy of free discussionmay be supposed to say, that there is no necessity for mankind ingeneral to know and understand all that can be said against or for theiropinions by philosophers and theologians end_token that it is not needful forcommon men to be able to expose all the misstatements or fallacies of aningenious opponent end_token that it is enough if there is always somebodycapable of answering them, so that nothing likely to misleaduninstructed persons remains unrefuted end_token that simple minds, having beentaught the obvious grounds of the truths inculcated on them, may trustto authority for the rest, and being aware that they have neitherknowledge nor talent to resolve every difficulty which can be raised,may repose in the assurance that all those which have been raised havebeen or can be answered, by those who are specially trained to the task end_tokenconceding to this view of the subject the utmost that can be claimed forit by those most easily satisfied with the amount of understanding oftruth which ought to accompany the belief of it; even so, the argumentfor free discussion is no way weakened end_token for even this doctrineacknowledges that mankind ought to have a rational assurance that allobjections have been satisfactorily answered; and how are they to beanswered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken? or how canthe answer be known to be satisfactory, if the objectors have noopportunity of showing that it is unsatisfactory? if not the public, atleast the philosophers and theologians who are to resolve thedifficulties, must make themselves familiar with those difficulties intheir most puzzling form; and this cannot be accomplished unless theyare freely stated, and placed in the most advantageous light which theyadmit of end_token the catholic church has its own way of dealing with thisembarrassing problem end_token it makes a broad separation between those who canbe permitted to receive its doctrines on conviction, and those who mustaccept them on trust end_token neither, indeed, are allowed any choice as to whatthey will accept; but the clergy, such at least as can be fully confidedin, may admissibly and meritoriously make themselves acquainted with thearguments of opponents, in order to answer them, and may, therefore,read heretical books; the laity, not unless by special permission, hardto be obtained end_token this discipline recognises a knowledge of the enemy'scase as beneficial to the teachers, but finds means, consistent withthis, of denying it to the rest of the world: thus giving to the ã©litemore mental culture, though not more mental freedom, than it allows tothe mass end_token by this device it succeeds in obtaining the kind of mentalsuperiority which its purposes require; for though culture withoutfreedom never made a large and liberal mind, it can make a clever _nisiprius_ advocate of a cause end_token but in countries professing protestantism,this resource is denied; since protestants hold, at least in theory,that the responsibility for the choice of a religion must be borne byeach for himself, and cannot be thrown off upon teachers end_token besides, inthe present state of the world, it is practically impossible thatwritings which are read by the instructed can be kept from theuninstructed end_token if the teachers of mankind are to be cognisant of all thatthey ought to know, everything must be free to be written and publishedwithout restraint end_tokenif, however, the mischievous operation of the absence of freediscussion, when the received opinions are true, were confined toleaving men ignorant of the grounds of those opinions, it might bethought that this, if an intellectual, is no moral evil, and does notaffect the worth of the opinions, regarded in their influence on thecharacter end_token the fact, however, is, that not only the grounds of theopinion are forgotten in the absence of discussion, but too often themeaning of the opinion itself end_token the words which convey it, cease tosuggest ideas, or suggest only a small portion of those they wereoriginally employed to communicate end_token instead of a vivid conception and aliving belief, there remain only a few phrases retained by rote; or, ifany part, the shell and husk only of the meaning is retained, the fineressence being lost end_token the great chapter in human history which this factoccupies and fills, cannot be too earnestly studied and meditated on end_tokenit is illustrated in the experience of almost all ethical doctrines andreligious creeds end_token they are all full of meaning and vitality to those whooriginate them, and to the direct disciples of the originators end_token theirmeaning continues to be felt in undiminished strength, and is perhapsbrought out into even fuller consciousness, so long as the strugglelasts to give the doctrine or creed an ascendency over other creeds end_token atlast it either prevails, and becomes the general opinion, or itsprogress stops; it keeps possession of the ground it has gained, butceases to spread further end_token when either of these results has becomeapparent, controversy on the subject flags, and gradually dies away end_token thedoctrine has taken its place, if not as a received opinion, as one ofthe admitted sects or divisions of opinion: those who hold it havegenerally inherited, not adopted it; and conversion from one of thesedoctrines to another, being now an exceptional fact, occupies littleplace in the thoughts of their professors end_token instead of being, as atfirst, constantly on the alert either to defend themselves against theworld, or to bring the world over to them, they have subsided intoacquiescence, and neither listen, when they can help it, to argumentsagainst their creed, nor trouble dissentients (if there be such) witharguments in its favour end_token from this time may usually be dated the declinein the living power of the doctrine end_token we often hear the teachers of allcreeds lamenting the difficulty of keeping up in the minds of believersa lively apprehension of the truth which they nominally recognise, sothat it may penetrate the feelings, and acquire a real mastery over theconduct end_token no such difficulty is complained of while the creed is stillfighting for its existence: even the weaker combatants then know andfeel what they are fighting for, and the difference between it and otherdoctrines; and in that period of every creed's existence, not a fewpersons may be found, who have realised its fundamental principles inall the forms of thought, have weighed and considered them in all theirimportant bearings, and have experienced the full effect on thecharacter, which belief in that creed ought to produce in a mindthoroughly imbued with it end_token but when it has come to be a hereditarycreed, and to be received passively, not actively--when the mind is nolonger compelled, in the same degree as at first, to exercise its vitalpowers on the questions which its belief presents to it, there is aprogressive tendency to forget all of the belief except theformularies, or to give it a dull and torpid assent, as if accepting iton trust dispensed with the necessity of realising it in consciousness,or testing it by personal experience; until it almost ceases to connectitself at all with the inner life of the human being end_token then are seen thecases, so frequent in this age of the world as almost to form themajority, in which the creed remains as it were outside the mind,encrusting and petrifying it against all other influences addressed tothe higher parts of our nature; manifesting its power by not sufferingany fresh and living conviction to get in, but itself doing nothing forthe mind or heart, except standing sentinel over them to keep themvacant end_tokento what an extent doctrines intrinsically fitted to make the deepestimpression upon the mind may remain in it as dead beliefs, without beingever realised in the imagination, the feelings, or the understanding, isexemplified by the manner in which the majority of believers hold thedoctrines of christianity end_token by christianity i here mean what is accountedsuch by all churches and sects--the maxims and precepts contained in thenew testament end_token these are considered sacred, and accepted as laws, by allprofessing christians end_token yet it is scarcely too much to say that not onechristian in a thousand guides or tests his individual conduct byreference to those laws end_token the standard to which he does refer it, is thecustom of his nation, his class, or his religious profession end_token he hasthus, on the one hand, a collection of ethical maxims, which he believesto have been vouchsafed to him by infallible wisdom as rules for hisgovernment; and on the other, a set of every-day judgments andpractices, which go a certain length with some of those maxims, not sogreat a length with others, stand in direct opposition to some, and are,on the whole, a compromise between the christian creed and the interestsand suggestions of worldly life end_token to the first of these standards hegives his homage; to the other his real allegiance end_token all christiansbelieve that the blessed are the poor and humble, and those who areill-used by the world; that it is easier for a camel to pass through theeye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven; thatthey should judge not, lest they be judged; that they should swear notat all; that they should love their neighbour as themselves; that if onetake their cloak, they should give him their coat also; that they shouldtake no thought for the morrow; that if they would be perfect, theyshould sell all that they have and give it to the poor end_token they are notinsincere when they say that they believe these things end_token they do believethem, as people believe what they have always heard lauded and neverdiscussed end_token but in the sense of that living belief which regulatesconduct, they believe these doctrines just up to the point to which itis usual to act upon them end_token the doctrines in their integrity areserviceable to pelt adversaries with; and it is understood that they areto be put forward (when possible) as the reasons for whatever people dothat they think laudable end_token but any one who reminded them that the maximsrequire an infinity of things which they never even think of doing,would gain nothing but to be classed among those very unpopularcharacters who affect to be better than other people end_token the doctrines haveno hold on ordinary believers--are not a power in their minds end_token they havea habitual respect for the sound of them, but no feeling which spreadsfrom the words to the things signified, and forces the mind to takethem in, and make them conform to the formula end_token whenever conduct isconcerned, they look round for mr end_token a and b to direct them how far to goin obeying christ end_tokennow we may be well assured that the case was not thus, but farotherwise, with the early christians end_token had it been thus, christianitynever would have expanded from an obscure sect of the despised hebrewsinto the religion of the roman empire end_token when their enemies said, \"see howthese christians love one another\" (a remark not likely to be made byanybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the meaningof their creed than they have ever had since end_token and to this cause,probably, it is chiefly owing that christianity now makes so littleprogress in extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries, is stillnearly confined to europeans and the descendants of europeans end_token even withthe strictly religious, who are much in earnest about their doctrines,and attach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than people ingeneral, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparativelyactive in their minds is that which was made by calvin, or knox, or somesuch person much nearer in character to themselves end_token the sayings ofchrist coexist passively in their minds, producing hardly any effectbeyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland end_tokenthere are many reasons, doubtless, why doctrines which are the badge ofa sect retain more of their vitality than those common to all recognisedsects, and why more pains are taken by teachers to keep their meaningalive; but one reason certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are morequestioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers end_tokenboth teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as thereis no enemy in the field end_tokenthe same thing holds true, generally speaking, of all traditionaldoctrines--those of prudence and knowledge of life, as well as of moralsor religion end_token all languages and literatures are full of generalobservations on life, both as to what it is, and how to conduct oneselfin it; observations which everybody knows, which everybody repeats, orhears with acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of whichmost people first truly learn the meaning, when experience, generally ofa painful kind, has made it a reality to them end_token how often, when smartingunder some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment, does a person callto mind some proverb or common saying, familiar to him all his life, themeaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now, wouldhave saved him from the calamity end_token there are indeed reasons for this,other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths of which thefull meaning cannot be realised, until personal experience has broughtit home end_token but much more of the meaning even of these would have beenunderstood, and what was understood would have been far more deeplyimpressed on the mind, if the man had been accustomed to hear it arguedpro and con by people who did understand it end_token the fatal tendency ofmankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longerdoubtful, is the cause of half their errors end_token a contemporary author haswell spoken of \"the deep slumber of a decided opinion end_token\"but what! (it may be asked) is the absence of unanimity an indispensablecondition of true knowledge? is it necessary that some part of mankindshould persist in error, to enable any to realise the truth? does abelief cease to be real and vital as soon as it is generallyreceived--and is a proposition never thoroughly understood and feltunless some doubt of it remains? as soon as mankind have unanimouslyaccepted a truth, does the truth perish within them? the highest aim andbest result of improved intelligence, it has hitherto been thought, isto unite mankind more and more in the acknowledgment of all importanttruths: and does the intelligence only last as long as it has notachieved its object? do the fruits of conquest perish by the verycompleteness of the victory?i affirm no such thing end_token as mankind improve, the number of doctrineswhich are no longer disputed or doubted will be constantly on theincrease: and the well-being of mankind may almost be measured by thenumber and gravity of the truths which have reached the point of beinguncontested end_token the cessation, on one question after another, of seriouscontroversy, is one of the necessary incidents of the consolidation ofopinion; a consolidation as salutary in the case of true opinions, as itis dangerous and noxious when the opinions are erroneous end_token but thoughthis gradual narrowing of the bounds of diversity of opinion isnecessary in both senses of the term, being at once inevitable andindispensable, we are not therefore obliged to conclude that all itsconsequences must be beneficial end_token the loss of so important an aid to theintelligent and living apprehension of a truth, as is afforded by thenecessity of explaining it to, or defending it against, opponents,though not sufficient to outweigh, is no trifling drawback from, thebenefit of its universal recognition end_token where this advantage can no longerbe had, i confess i should like to see the teachers of mankindendeavouring to provide a substitute for it; some contrivance for makingthe difficulties of the question as present to the learner'sconsciousness, as if they were pressed upon him by a dissentientchampion, eager for his conversion end_tokenbut instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose, they have lostthose they formerly had end_token the socratic dialectics, so magnificentlyexemplified in the dialogues of plato, were a contrivance of thisdescription end_token they were essentially a negative discussion of the greatquestions of philosophy and life, directed with consummate skill to thepurpose of convincing any one who had merely adopted the commonplaces ofreceived opinion, that he did not understand the subject--that he as yetattached no definite meaning to the doctrines he professed; in orderthat, becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in the way toattain a stable belief, resting on a clear apprehension both of themeaning of doctrines and of their evidence end_token the school disputations ofthe middle ages had a somewhat similar object end_token they were intended tomake sure that the pupil understood his own opinion, and (by necessarycorrelation) the opinion opposed to it, and could enforce the grounds ofthe one and confute those of the other end_token these last-mentioned contestshad indeed the incurable defect, that the premises appealed to weretaken from authority, not from reason; and, as a discipline to the mind,they were in every respect inferior to the powerful dialectics whichformed the intellects of the \"socratici viri\": but the modern mind owesfar more to both than it is generally willing to admit, and the presentmodes of education contain nothing which in the smallest degree suppliesthe place either of the one or of the other end_token a person who derives allhis instruction from teachers or books, even if he escape the besettingtemptation of contenting himself with cram, is under no compulsion tohear both sides; accordingly it is far from a frequent accomplishment,even among thinkers, to know both sides; and the weakest part of whateverybody says in defence of his opinion, is what he intends as a replyto antagonists end_token it is the fashion of the present time to disparagenegative logic--that which points out weaknesses in theory or errors inpractice, without establishing positive truths end_token such negative criticismwould indeed be poor enough as an ultimate result; but as a means toattaining any positive knowledge or conviction worthy the name, itcannot be valued too highly; and until people are again systematicallytrained to it, there will be few great thinkers, and a low generalaverage of intellect, in any but the mathematical and physicaldepartments of speculation end_token on any other subject no one's opinionsdeserve the name of knowledge, except so far as he has either hadforced upon him by others, or gone through of himself, the same mentalprocess which would have been required of him in carrying on an activecontroversy with opponents end_token that, therefore, which when absent, it is soindispensable, but so difficult, to create, how worse than absurd is itto forego, when spontaneously offering itself! if there are any personswho contest a received opinion, or who will do so if law or opinion willlet them, let us thank them for it, open our minds to listen to them,and rejoice that there is some one to do for us what we otherwise ought,if we have any regard for either the certainty or the vitality of ourconvictions, to do with much greater labour for ourselves end_tokenit still remains to speak of one of the principal causes which makediversity of opinion advantageous, and will continue to do so untilmankind shall have entered a stage of intellectual advancement which atpresent seems at an incalculable distance end_token we have hitherto consideredonly two possibilities: that the received opinion may be false, and someother opinion, consequently, true; or that, the received opinion beingtrue, a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clearapprehension and deep feeling of its truth end_token but there is a commonercase than either of these; when the conflicting doctrines, instead ofbeing one true and the other false, share the truth between them; andthe nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder of thetruth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part end_token popularopinions, on subjects not palpable to sense, are often true, but seldomor never the whole truth end_token they are a part of the truth; sometimes agreater, sometimes a smaller part, but exaggerated, distorted, anddisjoined from the truths by which they ought to be accompanied andlimited end_token heretical opinions, on the other hand, are generally some ofthese suppressed and neglected truths, bursting the bonds which keptthem down, and either seeking reconciliation with the truth contained inthe common opinion, or fronting it as enemies, and setting themselvesup, with similar exclusiveness, as the whole truth end_token the latter case ishitherto the most frequent, as, in the human mind, one-sidedness hasalways been the rule, and many-sidedness the exception end_token hence, even inrevolutions of opinion, one part of the truth usually sets while anotherrises end_token even progress, which ought to superadd, for the most part onlysubstitutes one partial and incomplete truth for another; improvementconsisting chiefly in this, that the new fragment of truth is morewanted, more adapted to the needs of the time, than that which itdisplaces end_token such being the partial character of prevailing opinions, evenwhen resting on a true foundation; every opinion which embodies somewhatof the portion of truth which the common opinion omits, ought to beconsidered precious, with whatever amount of error and confusion thattruth may be blended end_token no sober judge of human affairs will feel bound tobe indignant because those who force on our notice truths which weshould otherwise have overlooked, overlook some of those which we see end_tokenrather, he will think that so long as popular truth is one-sided, it ismore desirable than otherwise that unpopular truth should have one-sidedasserters too; such being usually the most energetic, and the mostlikely to compel reluctant attention to the fragment of wisdom whichthey proclaim as if it were the whole end_tokenthus, in the eighteenth century, when nearly all the instructed, and allthose of the uninstructed who were led by them, were lost in admirationof what is called civilisation, and of the marvels of modern science,literature, and philosophy, and while greatly overrating the amount ofunlikeness between the men of modern and those of ancient times,indulged the belief that the whole of the difference was in their ownfavour; with what a salutary shock did the paradoxes of rousseau explodelike bombshells in the midst, dislocating the compact mass of one-sidedopinion, and forcing its elements to recombine in a better form and withadditional ingredients end_token not that the current opinions were on the wholefarther from the truth than rousseau's were; on the contrary, they werenearer to it; they contained more of positive truth, and very much lessof error end_token nevertheless there lay in rousseau's doctrine, and has floateddown the stream of opinion along with it, a considerable amount ofexactly those truths which the popular opinion wanted; and these are thedeposit which was left behind when the flood subsided end_token the superiorworth of simplicity of life, the enervating and demoralising effect ofthe trammels and hypocrisies of artificial society, are ideas which havenever been entirely absent from cultivated minds since rousseau wrote;and they will in time produce their due effect, though at presentneeding to be asserted as much as ever, and to be asserted by deeds, forwords, on this subject, have nearly exhausted their power end_tokenin politics, again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of orderor stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessaryelements of a healthy state of political life; until the one or theother shall have so enlarged its mental grasp as to be a party equallyof order and of progress, knowing and distinguishing what is fit to bepreserved from what ought to be swept away end_token each of these modes ofthinking derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other; but itis in a great measure the opposition of the other that keeps each withinthe limits of reason and sanity end_token unless opinions favourable to democracyand to aristocracy, to property and to equality, to co-operation and tocompetition, to luxury and to abstinence, to sociality andindividuality, to liberty and discipline, and all the other standingantagonisms of practical life, are expressed with equal freedom, andenforced and defended with equal talent and energy, there is no chanceof both elements obtaining their due; one scale is sure to go up and theother down end_token truth, in the great practical concerns of life, is so much aquestion of the reconciling and combining of opposites, that very fewhave minds sufficiently capacious and impartial to make the adjustmentwith an approach to correctness, and it has to be made by the roughprocess of a struggle between combatants fighting under hostilebanners end_token on any of the great open questions just enumerated, if eitherof the two opinions has a better claim than the other, not merely to betolerated, but to be encouraged and countenanced, it is the one whichhappens at the particular time and place to be in a minority end_token that isthe opinion which, for the time being, represents the neglectedinterests, the side of human well-being which is in danger of obtainingless than its share end_token i am aware that there is not, in this country, anyintolerance of differences of opinion on most of these topics end_token they areadduced to show, by admitted and multiplied examples, the universalityof the fact, that only through diversity of opinion is there, in theexisting state of human intellect, a chance of fair-play to all sides ofthe truth end_token when there are persons to be found, who form an exception tothe apparent unanimity of the world on any subject, even if the world isin the right, it is always probable that dissentients have somethingworth hearing to say for themselves, and that truth would lose somethingby their silence end_tokenit may be objected, \"but some received principles, especially on thehighest and most vital subjects, are more than half-truths end_token thechristian morality, for instance, is the whole truth on that subject,and if any one teaches a morality which varies from it, he is wholly inerror end_token\" as this is of all cases the most important in practice, none canbe fitter to test the general maxim end_token but before pronouncing whatchristian morality is or is not, it would be desirable to decide what ismeant by christian morality end_token if it means the morality of the newtestament, i wonder that any one who derives his knowledge of this fromthe book itself, can suppose that it was announced, or intended, as acomplete doctrine of morals end_token the gospel always refers to a pre-existingmorality, and confines its precepts to the particulars in which thatmorality was to be corrected, or superseded by a wider and higher;expressing itself, moreover, in terms most general, often impossible tobe interpreted literally, and possessing rather the impressiveness ofpoetry or eloquence than the precision of legislation end_token to extract fromit a body of ethical doctrine, has ever been possible without eking itout from the old testament, that is, from a system elaborate indeed, butin many respects barbarous, and intended only for a barbarous people end_tokenst end_token paul, a declared enemy to this judaical mode of interpreting thedoctrine and filling up the scheme of his master, equally assumes apre-existing morality, namely, that of the greeks and romans; and hisadvice to christians is in a great measure a system of accommodation tothat; even to the extent of giving an apparent sanction to slavery end_token whatis called christian, but should rather be termed theological, morality,was not the work of christ or the apostles, but is of much later origin,having been gradually built up by the catholic church of the first fivecenturies, and though not implicitly adopted by moderns and protestants,has been much less modified by them than might have been expected end_token forthe most part, indeed, they have contented themselves with cutting offthe additions which had been made to it in the middle ages, each sectsupplying the place by fresh additions, adapted to its own character andtendencies end_token that mankind owe a great debt to this morality, and to itsearly teachers, i should be the last person to deny; but i do notscruple to say of it, that it is, in many important points, incompleteand one-sided, and that unless ideas and feelings, not sanctioned by it,had contributed to the formation of european life and character, humanaffairs would have been in a worse condition than they now are end_tokenchristian morality (so called) has all the characters of a reaction; itis, in great part, a protest against paganism end_token its ideal is negativerather than positive; passive rather than active; innocence rather thannobleness; abstinence from evil, rather than energetic pursuit of good:in its precepts (as has been well said) \"thou shalt not\" predominatesunduly over \"thou shalt end_token\" in its horror of sensuality, it made an idolof asceticism, which has been gradually compromised away into one oflegality end_token it holds out the hope of heaven and the threat of hell, as theappointed and appropriate motives to a virtuous life: in this fallingfar below the best of the ancients, and doing what lies in it to give tohuman morality an essentially selfish character, by disconnecting eachman's feelings of duty from the interests of his fellow-creatures,except so far as a self-interested inducement is offered to him forconsulting them end_token it is essentially a doctrine of passive obedience; itinculcates submission to all authorities found established; who indeedare not to be actively obeyed when they command what religion forbids,but who are not to be resisted, far less rebelled against, for anyamount of wrong to ourselves end_token and while, in the morality of the bestpagan nations, duty to the state holds even a disproportionate place,infringing on the just liberty of the individual; in purely christianethics, that grand department of duty is scarcely noticed oracknowledged end_token it is in the koran, not the new testament, that we readthe maxim--\"a ruler who appoints any man to an office, when there is inhis dominions another man better qualified for it, sins against god andagainst the state end_token\" what little recognition the idea of obligation tothe public obtains in modern morality, is derived from greek and romansources, not from christian; as, even in the morality of private life,whatever exists of magnanimity, high-mindedness, personal dignity, eventhe sense of honour, is derived from the purely human, not the religiouspart of our education, and never could have grown out of a standard ofethics in which the only worth, professedly recognised, is that ofobedience end_tokeni am as far as any one from pretending that these defects arenecessarily inherent in the christian ethics, in every manner in whichit can be conceived, or that the many requisites of a complete moraldoctrine which it does not contain, do not admit of being reconciledwith it end_token far less would i insinuate this of the doctrines and preceptsof christ himself end_token i believe that the sayings of christ are all, that ican see any evidence of their having been intended to be; that they areirreconcilable with nothing which a comprehensive morality requires;that everything which is excellent in ethics may be brought within them,with no greater violence to their language than has been done to it byall who have attempted to deduce from them any practical system ofconduct whatever end_token but it is quite consistent with this, to believe thatthey contain, and were meant to contain, only a part of the truth; thatmany essential elements of the highest morality are among the thingswhich are not provided for, nor intended to be provided for, in therecorded deliverances of the founder of christianity, and which havebeen entirely thrown aside in the system of ethics erected on the basisof those deliverances by the christian church end_token and this being so, ithink it a great error to persist in attempting to find in the christiandoctrine that complete rule for our guidance, which its author intendedit to sanction and enforce, but only partially to provide end_token i believe,too, that this narrow theory is becoming a grave practical evil,detracting greatly from the value of the moral training and instruction,which so many well-meaning persons are now at length exerting themselvesto promote end_token i much fear that by attempting to form the mind and feelingson an exclusively religious type, and discarding those secularstandards (as for want of a better name they may be called) whichheretofore co-existed with and supplemented the christian ethics,receiving some of its spirit, and infusing into it some of theirs, therewill result, and is even now resulting, a low, abject, servile type ofcharacter, which, submit itself as it may to what it deems the supremewill, is incapable of rising to or sympathising in the conception ofsupreme goodness end_token i believe that other ethics than any which can beevolved from exclusively christian sources, must exist side by side withchristian ethics to produce the moral regeneration of mankind; and thatthe christian system is no exception to the rule, that in an imperfectstate of the human mind, the interests of truth require a diversity ofopinions end_token it is not necessary that in ceasing to ignore the moral truthsnot contained in christianity, men should ignore any of those which itdoes contain end_token such prejudice, or oversight, when it occurs, isaltogether an evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be alwaysexempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good end_tokenthe exclusive pretension made by a part of the truth to be the whole,must and ought to be protested against, and if a reactionary impulseshould make the protestors unjust in their turn, this one-sidedness,like the other, may be lamented, but must be tolerated end_token if christianswould teach infidels to be just to christianity, they should themselvesbe just to infidelity end_token it can do truth no service to blink the fact,known to all who have the most ordinary acquaintance with literaryhistory, that a large portion of the noblest and most valuable moralteaching has been the work, not only of men who did not know, but of menwho knew and rejected, the christian faith end_tokeni do not pretend that the most unlimited use of the freedom ofenunciating all possible opinions would put an end to the evils ofreligious or philosophical sectarianism end_token every truth which men of narrowcapacity are in earnest about, is sure to be asserted, inculcated, andin many ways even acted on, as if no other truth existed in the world,or at all events none that could limit or qualify the first end_token iacknowledge that the tendency of all opinions to become sectarian is notcured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbatedthereby; the truth which ought to have been, but was not, seen, beingrejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons regardedas opponents end_token but it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on thecalmer and more disinterested bystander, that this collision ofopinions works its salutary effect end_token not the violent conflict betweenparts of the truth, but the quiet suppression of half of it, is theformidable evil: there is always hope when people are forced to listento both sides; it is when they attend only to one that errors hardeninto prejudices, and truth itself ceases to have the effect of truth, bybeing exaggerated into falsehood end_token and since there are few mentalattributes more rare than that judicial faculty which can sit inintelligent judgment between two sides of a question, of which only oneis represented by an advocate before it, truth has no chance but inproportion as every side of it, every opinion which embodies anyfraction of the truth, not only finds advocates, but is so advocated asto be listened to end_tokenwe have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind(on which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, andfreedom of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which wewill now briefly recapitulate end_tokenfirst, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, foraught we can certainly know, be true end_token to deny this is to assume our owninfallibility end_tokensecondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and verycommonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general orprevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, itis only by the collision of adverse opinions, that the remainder of thetruth has any chance of being supplied end_tokenthirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the wholetruth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously andearnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be heldin the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling ofits rational grounds end_token and not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning ofthe doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, anddeprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogmabecoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumberingthe ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfeltconviction, from reason or personal experience end_tokenbefore quitting the subject of freedom of opinion, it is fit to takesome notice of those who say, that the free expression of all opinionsshould be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and donot pass the bounds of fair discussion end_token much might be said on theimpossibility of fixing where these supposed bounds are to be placed;for if the test be offence to those whose opinion is attacked, i thinkexperience testifies that this offence is given whenever the attack istelling and powerful, and that every opponent who pushes them hard, andwhom they find it difficult to answer, appears to them, if he shows anystrong feeling on the subject, an intemperate opponent end_token but this, thoughan important consideration in a practical point of view, merges in amore fundamental objection end_token undoubtedly the manner of asserting anopinion, even though it be a true one, may be very objectionable, andmay justly incur severe censure end_token but the principal offences of the kindare such as it is mostly impossible, unless by accidental self-betrayal,to bring home to conviction end_token the gravest of them is, to arguesophistically, to suppress facts or arguments, to misstate the elementsof the case, or misrepresent the opposite opinion end_token but all this, even tothe most aggravated degree, is so continually done in perfect goodfaith, by persons who are not considered, and in many other respects maynot deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent, that it is rarelypossible on adequate grounds conscientiously to stamp themisrepresentation as morally culpable; and still less could law presumeto interfere with this kind of controversial misconduct end_token with regard towhat is commonly meant by intemperate discussion, namely invective,sarcasm, personality, and the like, the denunciation of these weaponswould deserve more sympathy if it were ever proposed to interdict themequally to both sides; but it is only desired to restrain the employmentof them against the prevailing opinion: against the unprevailing theymay not only be used without general disapproval, but will be likely toobtain for him who uses them the praise of honest zeal and righteousindignation end_token yet whatever mischief arises from their use, is greatestwhen they are employed against the comparatively defenceless; andwhatever unfair advantage can be derived by any opinion from this modeof asserting it, accrues almost exclusively to received opinions end_token theworst offence of this kind which can be committed by a polemic, is tostigmatise those who hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men end_tokento calumny of this sort, those who hold any unpopular opinion arepeculiarly exposed, because they are in general few and uninfluential,and nobody but themselves feel much interest in seeing justice donethem; but this weapon is, from the nature of the case, denied to thosewho attack a prevailing opinion: they can neither use it with safety tothemselves, nor, if they could, would it do anything but recoil on theirown cause end_token in general, opinions contrary to those commonly received canonly obtain a hearing by studied moderation of language, and the mostcautious avoidance of unnecessary offence, from which they hardly everdeviate even in a slight degree without losing ground: while unmeasuredvituperation employed on the side of the prevailing opinion, really doesdeter people from professing contrary opinions, and from listening tothose who profess them end_token for the interest, therefore, of truth andjustice, it is far more important to restrain this employment ofvituperative language than the other; and, for example, if it werenecessary to choose, there would be much more need to discourageoffensive attacks on infidelity, than on religion end_token it is, however,obvious that law and authority have no business with restraining either,while opinion ought, in every instance, to determine its verdict by thecircumstances of the individual case; condemning every one, on whicheverside of the argument he places himself, in whose mode of advocacy eitherwant of candour, or malignity, bigotry, or intolerance of feelingmanifest themselves; but not inferring these vices from the side whicha person takes, though it be the contrary side of the question to ourown: and giving merited honour to every one, whatever opinion he mayhold, who has calmness to see and honesty to state what his opponentsand their opinions really are, exaggerating nothing to their discredit,keeping nothing back which tells, or can be supposed to tell, in theirfavour end_token this is the real morality of public discussion; and if oftenviolated, i am happy to think that there are many controversialists whoto a great extent observe it, and a still greater number whoconscientiously strive towards it end_tokenthese words had scarcely been written, when, as if to give them anemphatic contradiction, occurred the government press prosecutions of1858 end_token that ill-judged interference with the liberty of public discussionhas not, however, induced me to alter a single word in the text, nor hasit at all weakened my conviction that, moments of panic excepted, theera of pains and penalties for political discussion has, in our owncountry, passed away end_token for, in the first place, the prosecutions were notpersisted in; and, in the second, they were never, properly speaking,political prosecutions end_token the offence charged was not that of criticisinginstitutions, or the acts or persons of rulers, but of circulating whatwas deemed an immoral doctrine, the lawfulness of tyrannicide end_tokenif the arguments of the present chapter are of any validity, there oughtto exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matterof ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may beconsidered end_token it would, therefore, be irrelevant and out of place toexamine here, whether the doctrine of tyrannicide deserves that title end_token ishall content myself with saying, that the subject has been at all timesone of the open questions of morals; that the act of a private citizenin striking down a criminal, who, by raising himself above the law, hasplaced himself beyond the reach of legal punishment or control, has beenaccounted by whole nations, and by some of the best and wisest of men,not a crime, but an act of exalted virtue; and that, right or wrong, itis not of the nature of assassination, but of civil war end_token as such, i holdthat the instigation to it, in a specific case, may be a proper subjectof punishment, but only if an overt act has followed, and at least aprobable connection can be established between the act and theinstigation end_token even then, it is not a foreign government, but the verygovernment assailed, which alone, in the exercise of self-defence, canlegitimately punish attacks directed against its own existence end_tokenthomas pooley, bodmin assizes, july 31, 1857 end_token in december following,he received a free pardon from the crown end_tokengeorge jacob holyoake, august 17, 1857;

that free scope should be given tovarieties of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth ofdifferent modes of life should be proved practically, when any onethinks fit to try them end_token it is desirable, in short, that in things whichdo not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself end_tokenwhere, not the person's own character, but the traditions or customs ofother people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of theprincipal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredientof individual and social progress end_tokenin maintaining this principle, the greatest difficulty to be encountereddoes not lie in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledged end,but in the indifference of persons in general to the end itself end_token if itwere felt that the free development of individuality is one of theleading essentials of well-being; that it is not only a co-ordinateelement with all that is designated by the terms civilisation,instruction, education, culture, but is itself a necessary part andcondition of all those things; there would be no danger that libertyshould be under-valued, and the adjustment of the boundaries between itand social control would present no extraordinary difficulty end_token but theevil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the commonmodes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving anyregard on its own account end_token the majority, being satisfied with the waysof mankind as they now are (for it is they who make them what they are),cannot comprehend why those ways should not be good enough foreverybody; and what is more, spontaneity forms no part of the ideal ofthe majority of moral and social reformers, but is rather looked on withjealousy, as a troublesome and perhaps rebellious obstruction to thegeneral acceptance of what these reformers, in their own judgment, thinkwould be best for mankind end_token few persons, out of germany, even comprehendthe meaning of the doctrine which wilhelm von humboldt, so eminent bothas a savant and as a politician, made the text of a treatise--that\"the end of man, or that which is prescribed by the eternal or immutabledictates of reason, and not suggested by vague and transient desires,is the highest and most harmonious development of his powers to acomplete and consistent whole;\" that, therefore, the object \"towardswhich every human being must ceaselessly direct his efforts, and onwhich especially those who design to influence their fellow-men mustever keep their eyes, is the individuality of power and development;\"that for this there are two requisites, \"freedom, and a variety ofsituations;\" and that from the union of these arise \"individual vigourand manifold diversity,\" which combine themselves in \"originality end_token\"little, however, as people are accustomed to a doctrine like that of vonhumboldt, and surprising as it may be to them to find so high a valueattached to individuality, the question, one must nevertheless think,can only be one of degree end_token no one's idea of excellence in conduct isthat people should do absolutely nothing but copy one another end_token no onewould assert that people ought not to put into their mode of life, andinto the conduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their ownjudgment, or of their own individual character end_token on the other hand, itwould be absurd to pretend that people ought to live as if nothingwhatever had been known in the world before they came into it; as ifexperience had as yet done nothing towards showing that one mode ofexistence, or of conduct, is preferable to another end_token nobody denies thatpeople should be so taught and trained in youth, as to know and benefitby the ascertained results of human experience end_token but it is the privilegeand proper condition of a human being, arrived at the maturity of hisfaculties, to use and interpret experience in his own way end_token it is for himto find out what part of recorded experience is properly applicable tohis own circumstances and character end_token the traditions and customs of otherpeople are, to a certain extent, evidence of what their experience hastaught _them_; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to hisdeference: but, in the first place, their experience may be too narrow;or they may not have interpreted it rightly end_token secondly, theirinterpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuitable to him end_tokencustoms are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters:and his circumstances or his character may be uncustomary end_token thirdly,though the customs be both good as customs, and suitable to him, yet toconform to custom, merely as custom, does not educate or develop inhim any of the qualities which are the distinctive endowment of a humanbeing end_token the human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminativefeeling, mental activity, and even moral preference, are exercised onlyin making a choice end_token he who does anything because it is the custom, makesno choice end_token he gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring whatis best end_token the mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improvedonly by being used end_token the faculties are called into no exercise by doing athing merely because others do it, no more than by believing a thingonly because others believe it end_token if the grounds of an opinion are notconclusive to the person's own reason, his reason cannot bestrengthened, but is likely to be weakened by his adopting it: and ifthe inducements to an act are not such as are consentaneous to his ownfeelings and character (where affection, or the rights of others, arenot concerned), it is so much done towards rendering his feelings andcharacter inert and torpid, instead of active and energetic end_tokenhe who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of lifefor him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one ofimitation end_token he who chooses his plan for himself, employs all hisfaculties end_token he must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment toforesee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination todecide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold tohis deliberate decision end_token and these qualities he requires and exercisesexactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determinesaccording to his own judgment and feelings is a large one end_token it ispossible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out ofharm's way, without any of these things end_token but what will be hiscomparative worth as a human being? it really is of importance, not onlywhat men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it end_token among theworks of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting andbeautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself end_token supposing itwere possible to get houses built, corn grown, battles fought, causestried, and even churches erected and prayers said, by machinery--byautomatons in human form--it would be a considerable loss to exchangefor these automatons even the men and women who at present inhabit themore civilised parts of the world, and who assuredly are but starvedspecimens of what nature can and will produce end_token human nature is not amachine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the workprescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and developitself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forceswhich make it a living thing end_tokenit will probably be conceded that it is desirable people should exercisetheir understandings, and that an intelligent following of custom, oreven occasionally an intelligent deviation from custom, is better than ablind and simply mechanical adhesion to it end_token to a certain extent it isadmitted, that our understanding should be our own: but there is not thesame willingness to admit that our desires and impulses should be ourown likewise; or that to possess impulses of our own, and of anystrength, is anything but a peril and a snare end_token yet desires and impulsesare as much a part of a perfect human being, as beliefs and restraints:and strong impulses are only perilous when not properly balanced; whenone set of aims and inclinations is developed into strength, whileothers, which ought to co-exist with them, remain weak and inactive end_token itis not because men's desires are strong that they act ill; it is becausetheir consciences are weak end_token there is no natural connection betweenstrong impulses and a weak conscience end_token the natural connection is theother way end_token to say that one person's desires and feelings are strongerand more various than those of another, is merely to say that he hasmore of the raw material of human nature, and is therefore capable,perhaps of more evil, but certainly of more good end_token strong impulses arebut another name for energy end_token energy may be turned to bad uses; but moregood may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent andimpassive one end_token those who have most natural feeling, are always thosewhose cultivated feelings may be made the strongest end_token the same strongsusceptibilities which make the personal impulses vivid and powerful,are also the source from whence are generated the most passionate loveof virtue, and the sternest self-control end_token it is through the cultivationof these, that society both does its duty and protects its interests:not by rejecting the stuff of which heroes are made, because it knowsnot how to make them end_token a person whose desires and impulses are hisown--are the expression of his own nature, as it has been developed andmodified by his own culture--is said to have a character end_token one whosedesires and impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than asteam-engine has a character end_token if, in addition to being his own, hisimpulses are strong, and are under the government of a strong will, hehas an energetic character end_token whoever thinks that individuality ofdesires and impulses should not be encouraged to unfold itself, mustmaintain that society has no need of strong natures--is not the betterfor containing many persons who have much character--and that a highgeneral average of energy is not desirable end_tokenin some early states of society, these forces might be, and were, toomuch ahead of the power which society then possessed of disciplining andcontrolling them end_token there has been a time when the element of spontaneityand individuality was in excess, and the social principle had a hardstruggle with it end_token the difficulty then was, to induce men of strongbodies or minds to pay obedience to any rules which required them tocontrol their impulses end_token to overcome this difficulty, law and discipline,like the popes struggling against the emperors, asserted a power overthe whole man, claiming to control all his life in order to control hischaracter--which society had not found any other sufficient means ofbinding end_token but society has now fairly got the better of individuality; andthe danger which threatens human nature is not the excess, but thedeficiency, of personal impulses and preferences end_token things are vastlychanged, since the passions of those who were strong by station or bypersonal endowment were in a state of habitual rebellion against lawsand ordinances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable thepersons within their reach to enjoy any particle of security end_token in ourtimes, from the highest class of society down to the lowest, every onelives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship end_token not only inwhat concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, theindividual, or the family, do not ask themselves--what do i prefer? or,what would suit my character and disposition? or, what would allow thebest and highest in me to have fair-play, and enable it to grow andthrive? they ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? what isusually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or(worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station andcircumstances superior to mine? i do not mean that they choose what iscustomary, in preference to what suits their own inclination end_token it doesnot occur to them to have any inclination, except for what is customary end_tokenthus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what people do forpleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of; they live in crowds;they exercise choice only among things commonly done: peculiarity oftaste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes: untilby dint of not following their own nature, they have no nature tofollow: their human capacities are withered and starved: they becomeincapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generallywithout either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly theirown end_token now is this, or is it not, the desirable condition of human nature?it is so, on the calvinistic theory end_token according to that, the one greatoffence of man is self-will end_token all the good of which humanity is capable,is comprised in obedience end_token you have no choice; thus you must do, and nootherwise: \"whatever is not a duty, is a sin end_token\" human nature beingradically corrupt, there is no redemption for any one until human natureis killed within him end_token to one holding this theory of life, crushing outany of the human faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is noevil: man needs no capacity, but that of surrendering himself to thewill of god: and if he uses any of his faculties for any other purposebut to do that supposed will more effectually, he is better withoutthem end_token that is the theory of calvinism; and it is held, in a mitigatedform, by many who do not consider themselves calvinists; the mitigationconsisting in giving a less ascetic interpretation to the alleged willof god; asserting it to be his will that mankind should gratify some oftheir inclinations; of course not in the manner they themselves prefer,but in the way of obedience, that is, in a way prescribed to them byauthority; and, therefore, by the necessary conditions of the case, thesame for all end_tokenin some such insidious form there is at present a strong tendency tothis narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type ofhuman character which it patronises end_token many persons, no doubt, sincerelythink that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their makerdesigned them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a muchfiner thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures ofanimals, than as nature made them end_token but if it be any part of religion tobelieve that man was made by a good being, it is more consistent withthat faith to believe, that this being gave all human faculties thatthey might be cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, andthat he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures tothe ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of theircapabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment end_token there is adifferent type of human excellence from the calvinistic; a conception ofhumanity as having its nature bestowed on it for other purposes thanmerely to be abnegated end_token \"pagan self-assertion\" is one of the elements ofhuman worth, as well as \"christian self-denial end_token\"there is a greekideal of self-development, which the platonic and christian ideal ofself-government blends with, but does not supersede end_token it may be better tobe a john knox than an alcibiades, but it is better to be a periclesthan either; nor would a pericles, if we had one in these days, bewithout anything good which belonged to john knox end_tokenit is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual inthemselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within thelimits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beingsbecome a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the workspartake the character of those who do them, by the same process humanlife also becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing moreabundant aliment to high thoughts and elevating feelings, andstrengthening the tie which binds every individual to the race, bymaking the race infinitely better worth belonging to end_token in proportion tothe development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuableto himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others end_tokenthere is a greater fulness of life about his own existence, and whenthere is more life in the units there is more in the mass which iscomposed of them end_token as much compression as is necessary to prevent thestronger specimens of human nature from encroaching on the rights ofothers, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is amplecompensation even in the point of view of human development end_token the meansof development which the individual loses by being prevented fromgratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chieflyobtained at the expense of the development of other people end_token and even tohimself there is a full equivalent in the better development of thesocial part of his nature, rendered possible by the restraint put uponthe selfish part end_token to be held to rigid rules of justice for the sake ofothers, develops the feelings and capacities which have the good ofothers for their object end_token but to be restrained in things not affectingtheir good, by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable, exceptsuch force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint end_tokenif acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature end_token to give anyfair-play to the nature of each, it is essential that different personsshould be allowed to lead different lives end_token in proportion as thislatitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy toposterity end_token even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long asindividuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality isdespotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professesto be enforcing the will of god or the injunctions of men end_tokenhaving said that individuality is the same thing with development, andthat it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces, or canproduce, well-developed human beings, i might here close the argument:for what more or better can be said of any condition of human affairs,than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thingthey can be? or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good, thanthat it prevents this? doubtless, however, these considerations will notsuffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessaryfurther to show, that these developed human beings are of some use tothe undeveloped--to point out to those who do not desire liberty, andwould not avail themselves of it, that they may be in some intelligiblemanner rewarded for allowing other people to make use of it withouthindrance end_tokenin the first place, then, i would suggest that they might possiblylearn something from them end_token it will not be denied by anybody, thatoriginality is a valuable element in human affairs end_token there is always needof persons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what wereonce truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, andset the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sensein human life end_token this cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does notbelieve that the world has already attained perfection in all its waysand practices end_token it is true that this benefit is not capable of beingrendered by everybody alike: there are but few persons, in comparisonwith the whole of mankind, whose experiments, if adopted by others,would be likely to be any improvement on established practice end_token but thesefew are the salt of the earth; without them, human life would become astagnant pool end_token not only is it they who introduce good things which didnot before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which alreadyexisted end_token if there were nothing new to be done, would human intellectcease to be necessary? would it be a reason why those who do the oldthings should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, notlike human beings? there is only too great a tendency in the bestbeliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unlessthere were a succession of persons whose ever-recurring originalityprevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merelytraditional, such dead matter would not resist the smallest shock fromanything really alive, and there would be no reason why civilisationshould not die out, as in the byzantine empire end_token persons of genius, it istrue, are, and are always likely to be, a small minority; but in orderto have them, it is necessary to preserve the soil in which they grow end_tokengenius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom end_token persons ofgenius are, _ex vi termini_, more individual than any otherpeople--less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, withouthurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds whichsociety provides in order to save its members the trouble of formingtheir own character end_token if from timidity they consent to be forced into oneof these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannotexpand under the pressure remain unexpanded, society will be little thebetter for their genius end_token if they are of a strong character, and breaktheir fetters, they become a mark for the society which has notsucceeded in reducing them to commonplace, to point at with solemnwarning as \"wild,\" \"erratic,\" and the like; much as if one shouldcomplain of the niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its bankslike a dutch canal end_tokeni insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and thenecessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in thought and inpractice, being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory,but knowing also that almost every one, in reality, is totallyindifferent to it end_token people think genius a fine thing if it enables a manto write an exciting poem, or paint a picture end_token but in its true sense,that of originality in thought and action, though no one says that it isnot a thing to be admired, nearly all, at heart, think that they can dovery well without it end_token unhappily this is too natural to be wondered at end_tokenoriginality is the one thing which unoriginal minds cannot feel the useof end_token they cannot see what it is to do for them: how should they? if theycould see what it would do for them, it would not be originality end_token thefirst service which originality has to render them, is that of openingtheir eyes: which being once fully done, they would have a chance ofbeing themselves original end_token meanwhile, recollecting that nothing was everyet done which some one was not the first to do, and that all goodthings which exist are the fruits of originality, let them be modestenough to believe that there is something still left for it toaccomplish, and assure themselves that they are more in need oforiginality, the less they are conscious of the want end_tokenin sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to realor supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of thingsthroughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power amongmankind end_token in ancient history, in the middle ages, and in a diminishingdegree through the long transition from feudality to the present time,the individual was a power in himself; and if he had either greattalents or a high social position, he was a considerable power end_token atpresent individuals are lost in the crowd end_token in politics it is almost atriviality to say that public opinion now rules the world end_token the onlypower deserving the name is that of masses, and of governments whilethey make themselves the organ of the tendencies and instincts ofmasses end_token this is as true in the moral and social relations of privatelife as in public transactions end_token those whose opinions go by the name ofpublic opinion, are not always the same sort of public: in america theyare the whole white population; in england, chiefly the middle class end_tokenbut they are always a mass, that is to say, collective mediocrity end_token andwhat is a still greater novelty, the mass do not now take their opinionsfrom dignitaries in church or state, from ostensible leaders, or frombooks end_token their thinking is done for them by men much like themselves,addressing them or speaking in their name, on the spur of the moment,through the newspapers end_token i am not complaining of all this end_token i do notassert that anything better is compatible, as a general rule, with thepresent low state of the human mind end_token but that does not hinder thegovernment of mediocrity from being mediocre government end_token no governmentby a democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its political actsor in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it fosters, everdid or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereignmany have let themselves be guided (which in their best times theyalways have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly giftedand instructed one or few end_token the initiation of all wise or noble things,comes and must come from individuals; generally at first from some oneindividual end_token the honour and glory of the average man is that he iscapable of following that initiative; that he can respond internally towise and noble things, and be led to them with his eyes open end_token i am notcountenancing the sort of \"hero-worship\" which applauds the strong manof genius for forcibly seizing on the government of the world and makingit do his bidding in spite of itself end_token all he can claim is, freedom topoint out the way end_token the power of compelling others into it, is not onlyinconsistent with the freedom and development of all the rest, butcorrupting to the strong man himself end_token it does seem, however, that whenthe opinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become orbecoming the dominant power, the counterpoise and corrective to thattendency would be, the more and more pronounced individuality of thosewho stand on the higher eminences of thought end_token it is in thesecircumstances most especially, that exceptional individuals, instead ofbeing deterred, should be encouraged in acting differently from themass end_token in other times there was no advantage in their doing so, unlessthey acted not only differently, but better end_token in this age the mereexample of nonconformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom,is itself a service end_token precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such asto make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to breakthrough that tyranny, that people should be eccentric end_token eccentricity hasalways abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; andthe amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportionalto the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which itcontained end_token that so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief dangerof the time end_tokeni have said that it is important to give the freest scope possible touncustomary things, in order that it may in time appear which of theseare fit to be converted into customs end_token but independence of action, anddisregard of custom are not solely deserving of encouragement for thechance they afford that better modes of action, and customs more worthyof general adoption, may be struck out; nor is it only persons ofdecided mental superiority who have a just claim to carry on their livesin their own way end_token there is no reason that all human existences should beconstructed on some one, or some small number of patterns end_token if a personpossesses any tolerable amount of common-sense and experience, his ownmode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the bestin itself, but because it is his own mode end_token human beings are not likesheep; and even sheep are not undistinguishably alike end_token a man cannot geta coat or a pair of boots to fit him, unless they are either made to hismeasure, or he has a whole warehouseful to choose from: and is it easierto fit him with a life than with a coat, or are human beings more likeone another in their whole physical and spiritual conformation than inthe shape of their feet? if it were only that people have diversities oftaste, that is reason enough for not attempting to shape them all afterone model end_token but different persons also require different conditions fortheir spiritual development; and can no more exist healthily in the samemoral, than all the variety of plants can in the same physical,atmosphere and climate end_token the same things which are helps to one persontowards the cultivation of his higher nature, are hindrances to another end_tokenthe same mode of life is a healthy excitement to one, keeping all hisfaculties of action and enjoyment in their best order, while to anotherit is a distracting burthen, which suspends or crushes all internallife end_token such are the differences among human beings in their sources ofpleasure, their susceptibilities of pain, and the operation on them ofdifferent physical and moral agencies, that unless there is acorresponding diversity in their modes of life, they neither obtaintheir fair share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, andaesthetic stature of which their nature is capable end_token why then shouldtolerance, as far as the public sentiment is concerned, extend only totastes and modes of life which extort acquiescence by the multitude oftheir adherents? nowhere (except in some monastic institutions) isdiversity of taste entirely unrecognised; a person may, without blame,either like or dislike rowing, or smoking, or music, or athleticexercises, or chess, or cards, or study, because both those who likeeach of these things, and those who dislike them, are too numerous to beput down end_token but the man, and still more the woman, who can be accusedeither of doing \"what nobody does,\" or of not doing \"what everybodydoes,\" is the subject of as much depreciatory remark as if he or she hadcommitted some grave moral delinquency end_token persons require to possess atitle, or some other badge of rank, or of the consideration of people ofrank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxury of doing as they likewithout detriment to their estimation end_token to indulge somewhat, i repeat:for whoever allow themselves much of that indulgence, incur the risk ofsomething worse than disparaging speeches--they are in peril of acommission _de lunatico_, and of having their property taken from themand given to their relations end_tokenthere is one characteristic of the present direction of public opinion,peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstrationof individuality end_token the general average of mankind are not only moderatein intellect, but also moderate in inclinations: they have no tastes orwishes strong enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and theyconsequently do not understand those who have, and class all such withthe wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon end_tokennow, in addition to this fact which is general, we have only to supposethat a strong movement has set in towards the improvement of morals,and it is evident what we have to expect end_token in these days such a movementhas set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increasedregularity of conduct, and discouragement of excesses; and there is aphilanthropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no moreinviting field than the moral and prudential improvement of ourfellow-creatures end_token these tendencies of the times cause the public to bemore disposed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules ofconduct, and endeavour to make every one conform to the approvedstandard end_token and that standard, express or tacit, is to desire nothingstrongly end_token its ideal of character is to be without any marked character;to maim by compression, like a chinese lady's foot, every part of humannature which stands out prominently, and tends to make the personmarkedly dissimilar in outline to commonplace humanity end_tokenas is usually the case with ideals which exclude one-half of what isdesirable, the present standard of approbation produces only an inferiorimitation of the other half end_token instead of great energies guided byvigorous reason, and strong feelings strongly controlled by aconscientious will, its result is weak feelings and weak energies, whichtherefore can be kept in outward conformity to rule without any strengtheither of will or of reason end_token already energetic characters on any largescale are becoming merely traditional end_token there is now scarcely any outletfor energy in this country except business end_token the energy expended in thatmay still be regarded as considerable end_token what little is left from thatemployment, is expended on some hobby; which may be a useful, even aphilanthropic hobby, but is always some one thing, and generally a thingof small dimensions end_token the greatness of england is now all collective:individually small, we only appear capable of anything great by ourhabit of combining; and with this our moral and religiousphilanthropists are perfectly contented end_token but it was men of anotherstamp than this that made england what it has been; and men of anotherstamp will be needed to prevent its decline end_tokenthe despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to humanadvancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim atsomething better than customary, which is called, according tocircumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress orimprovement end_token the spirit of improvement is not always a spirit ofliberty, for it may aim at forcing improvements on an unwilling people;and the spirit of liberty, in so far as it resists such attempts, mayally itself locally and temporarily with the opponents of improvement;but the only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is liberty,since by it there are as many possible independent centres ofimprovement as there are individuals end_token the progressive principle,however, in either shape, whether as the love of liberty or ofimprovement, is antagonistic to the sway of custom, involving at leastemancipation from that yoke; and the contest between the two constitutesthe chief interest of the history of mankind end_token the greater part of theworld has, properly speaking, no history, because the despotism ofcustom is complete end_token this is the case over the whole east end_token custom isthere, in all things, the final appeal;

they did not start out ofthe ground populous, lettered, and versed in many of the arts of life;they made themselves all this, and were then the greatest and mostpowerful nations in the world end_token what are they now? the subjects ordependants of tribes whose forefathers wandered in the forests whentheirs had magnificent palaces and gorgeous temples, but over whomcustom exercised only a divided rule with liberty and progress end_token apeople, it appears, may be progressive for a certain length of time, andthen stop: when does it stop? when it ceases to possess individuality end_tokenif a similar change should befall the nations of europe, it will not bein exactly the same shape: the despotism of custom with which thesenations are threatened is not precisely stationariness end_token it proscribessingularity, but it does not preclude change, provided all changetogether end_token we have discarded the fixed costumes of our forefathers; everyone must still dress like other people, but the fashion may change onceor twice a year end_token we thus take care that when there is change, it shallbe for change's sake, and not from any idea of beauty or convenience;for the same idea of beauty or convenience would not strike all theworld at the same moment, and be simultaneously thrown aside by all atanother moment end_token but we are progressive as well as changeable: wecontinually make new inventions in mechanical things, and keep themuntil they are again superseded by better; we are eager for improvementin politics, in education, even in morals, though in this last our ideaof improvement chiefly consists in persuading or forcing other people tobe as good as ourselves end_token it is not progress that we object to;

and althoughat every period those who travelled in different paths have beenintolerant of one another, and each would have thought it an excellentthing if all the rest could have been compelled to travel his road,their attempts to thwart each other's development have rarely had anypermanent success, and each has in time endured to receive the goodwhich the others have offered end_token europe is, in my judgment, whollyindebted to this plurality of paths for its progressive and many-sideddevelopment end_token but it already begins to possess this benefit in aconsiderably less degree end_token it is decidedly advancing towards the chineseideal of making all people alike end_token m end_token de tocqueville, in his lastimportant work, remarks how much more the frenchmen of the present dayresemble one another, than did those even of the last generation end_token thesame remark might be made of englishmen in a far greater degree end_token in apassage already quoted from wilhelm von humboldt, he points out twothings as necessary conditions of human development, because necessaryto render people unlike one another;

asthe very idea of resisting the will of the public, when it is positivelyknown that they have a will, disappears more and more from the minds ofpractical politicians; there ceases to be any social support fornon-conformity--any substantive power in society, which, itself opposedto the ascendency of numbers, is interested in taking under itsprotection opinions and tendencies at variance with those of the public end_tokenthe combination of all these causes forms so great a mass of influenceshostile to individuality, that it is not easy to see how it can standits ground end_token it will do so with increasing difficulty, unless theintelligent part of the public can be made to feel its value--to seethat it is good there should be differences, even though not for thebetter, even though, as it may appear to them, some should be for theworse end_token if the claims of individuality are ever to be asserted, the timeis now, while much is still wanting to complete the enforcedassimilation end_token it is only in the earlier stages that any stand can besuccessfully made against the encroachment end_token the demand that all otherpeople shall resemble ourselves, grows by what it feeds on end_token ifresistance waits till life is reduced nearly to one uniform type, alldeviations from that type will come to be considered impious, immoral,even monstrous and contrary to nature end_token mankind speedily become unable toconceive diversity, when they have been for some time unaccustomed tosee it end_tokenfrom the german of baron wilhelm von humboldt, pp end_token 11-13 end_tokenthere is something both contemptible and frightful in the sort ofevidence on which, of late years, any person can be judicially declaredunfit for the management of his affairs;

but of this he has no right to complain,unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his socialrelations, and has thus established a title to their good offices, whichis not affected by his demerits towards himself end_tokenwhat i contend for is, that the inconveniences which are strictlyinseparable from the unfavourable judgment of others, are the only onesto which a person should ever be subjected for that portion of hisconduct and character which concerns his own good, but which does notaffect the interests of others in their relations with him end_token actsinjurious to others require a totally different treatment end_token encroachmenton their rights; infliction on them of any loss or damage not justifiedby his own rights; falsehood or duplicity in dealing with them; unfairor ungenerous use of advantages over them; even selfish abstinence fromdefending them against injury--these are fit objects of moralreprobation, and, in grave cases, of moral retribution and punishment end_tokenand not only these acts, but the dispositions which lead to them, areproperly immoral, and fit subjects of disapprobation which may rise toabhorrence end_token cruelty of disposition;

the pride which derives gratification fromthe abasement of others; the egotism which thinks self and its concernsmore important than everything else, and decides all doubtful questionsin its own favour;--these are moral vices, and constitute a bad andodious moral character: unlike the self-regarding faults previouslymentioned, which are not properly immoralities, and to whatever pitchthey may be carried, do not constitute wickedness end_token they may be proofs ofany amount of folly, or want of personal dignity and self-respect; butthey are only a subject of moral reprobation when they involve a breachof duty to others, for whose sake the individual is bound to have carefor himself end_token what are called duties to ourselves are not sociallyobligatory, unless circumstances render them at the same time duties toothers end_token the term duty to oneself, when it means anything more thanprudence, means self-respect or self-development; and for none of theseis any one accountable to his fellow-creatures, because for none of themis it for the good of mankind that he be held accountable to them end_tokenthe distinction between the loss of consideration which a person mayrightly incur by defect of prudence or of personal dignity, and thereprobation which is due to him for an offence against the rights ofothers, is not a merely nominal distinction end_token it makes a vast differenceboth in our feelings and in our conduct towards him, whether hedispleases us in things in which we think we have a right to controlhim, or in things in which we know that we have not end_token if he displeasesus, we may express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a person aswell as from a thing that displeases us;

we shall not treat him like an enemy of society: the worstwe shall think ourselves justified in doing is leaving him to himself,if we do not interfere benevolently by showing interest or concern forhim end_token it is far otherwise if he has infringed the rules necessary for theprotection of his fellow-creatures, individually or collectively end_token theevil consequences of his acts do not then fall on himself, but onothers; and society, as the protector of all its members, must retaliateon him; must inflict pain on him for the express purpose of punishment,and must take care that it be sufficiently severe end_token in the one case, heis an offender at our bar, and we are called on not only to sit injudgment on him, but, in one shape or another, to execute our ownsentence: in the other case, it is not our part to inflict any sufferingon him, except what may incidentally follow from our using the sameliberty in the regulation of our own affairs, which we allow to him inhis end_tokenthe distinction here pointed out between the part of a person's lifewhich concerns only himself, and that which concerns others, manypersons will refuse to admit end_token how (it may be asked) can any part of theconduct of a member of society be a matter of indifference to the othermembers? no person is an entirely isolated being; it is impossible for aperson to do anything seriously or permanently hurtful to himself,without mischief reaching at least to his near connections, and oftenfar beyond them end_token if he injures his property, he does harm to those whodirectly or indirectly derived support from it, and usually diminishes,by a greater or less amount, the general resources of the community end_token ifhe deteriorates his bodily or mental faculties, he not only brings evilupon all who depended on him for any portion of their happiness, butdisqualifies himself for rendering the services which he owes to hisfellow-creatures generally; perhaps becomes a burthen on their affectionor benevolence; and if such conduct were very frequent, hardly anyoffence that is committed would detract more from the general sum ofgood end_token finally, if by his vices or follies a person does no direct harmto others, he is nevertheless (it may be said) injurious by his example;and ought to be compelled to control himself, for the sake of those whomthe sight or knowledge of his conduct might corrupt or mislead end_tokenand even (it will be added) if the consequences of misconduct could beconfined to the vicious or thoughtless individual, ought society toabandon to their own guidance those who are manifestly unfit for it? ifprotection against themselves is confessedly due to children and personsunder age, is not society equally bound to afford it to persons ofmature years who are equally incapable of self-government? if gambling,or drunkenness, or incontinence, or idleness, or uncleanliness, are asinjurious to happiness, and as great a hindrance to improvement, as manyor most of the acts prohibited by law, why (it may be asked) should notlaw, so far as is consistent with practicability and social convenience,endeavour to repress these also? and as a supplement to the unavoidableimperfections of law, ought not opinion at least to organise a powerfulpolice against these vices, and visit rigidly with social penaltiesthose who are known to practise them? there is no question here (it maybe said) about restricting individuality, or impeding the trial of newand original experiments in living end_token the only things it is sought toprevent are things which have been tried and condemned from thebeginning of the world until now; things which experience has shown notto be useful or suitable to any person's individuality end_token there must besome length of time and amount of experience, after which a moral orprudential truth may be regarded as established: and it is merelydesired to prevent generation after generation from falling over thesame precipice which has been fatal to their predecessors end_tokeni fully admit that the mischief which a person does to himself, mayseriously affect, both through their sympathies and their interests,those nearly connected with him, and in a minor degree, society atlarge end_token when, by conduct of this sort, a person is led to violate adistinct and assignable obligation to any other person or persons, thecase is taken out of the self-regarding class, and becomes amenable tomoral disapprobation in the proper sense of the term end_token if, for example,a man, through intemperance or extravagance, becomes unable to pay hisdebts, or, having undertaken the moral responsibility of a family,becomes from the same cause incapable of supporting or educating them,he is deservedly reprobated, and might be justly punished;

it cannot indeedmake them perfectly wise and good, because it is itself so lamentablydeficient in goodness and wisdom; and its best efforts are not always,in individual cases, its most successful ones; but it is perfectly wellable to make the rising generation, as a whole, as good as, and a littlebetter than, itself end_token if society lets any considerable number of itsmembers grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rationalconsideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for theconsequences end_token armed not only with all the powers of education, but withthe ascendency which the authority of a received opinion alwaysexercises over the minds who are least fitted to judge for themselves;and aided by the natural penalties which cannot be prevented fromfalling on those who incur the distaste or the contempt of those whoknow them; let not society pretend that it needs, besides all this, thepower to issue commands and enforce obedience in the personal concernsof individuals, in which, on all principles of justice and policy, thedecision ought to rest with those who are to abide the consequences end_token noris there anything which tends more to discredit and frustrate the bettermeans of influencing conduct, than a resort to the worse end_token if there beamong those whom it is attempted to coerce into prudence or temperance,any of the material of which vigorous and independent characters aremade, they will infallibly rebel against the yoke end_token no such person willever feel that others have a right to control him in his concerns, suchas they have to prevent him from injuring them in theirs; and it easilycomes to be considered a mark of spirit and courage to fly in the faceof such usurped authority, and do with ostentation the exact opposite ofwhat it enjoins; as in the fashion of grossness which succeeded, in thetime of charles ii end_token, to the fanatical moral intolerance of the puritans end_tokenwith respect to what is said of the necessity of protecting societyfrom the bad example set to others by the vicious or theself-indulgent; it is true that bad example may have a perniciouseffect, especially the example of doing wrong to others with impunity tothe wrong-doer end_token but we are now speaking of conduct which, while it doesno wrong to others, is supposed to do great harm to the agent himself:and i do not see how those who believe this, can think otherwise thanthat the example, on the whole, must be more salutary than hurtful,since, if it displays the misconduct, it displays also the painful ordegrading consequences which, if the conduct is justly censured, must besupposed to be in all or most cases attendant on it end_tokenbut the strongest of all the arguments against the interference of thepublic with purely personal conduct, is that when it does interfere, theodds are that it interferes wrongly, and in the wrong place end_token onquestions of social morality, of duty to others, the opinion of thepublic, that is, of an overruling majority, though often wrong, islikely to be still oftener right; because on such questions they areonly required to judge of their own interests; of the manner in whichsome mode of conduct, if allowed to be practised, would affectthemselves end_token but the opinion of a similar majority, imposed as a law onthe minority, on questions of self-regarding conduct, is quite aslikely to be wrong as right; for in these cases public opinion means, atthe best, some people's opinion of what is good or bad for other people;while very often it does not even mean that; the public, with the mostperfect indifference, passing over the pleasure or convenience of thosewhose conduct they censure, and considering only their own preference end_tokenthere are many who consider as an injury to themselves any conduct whichthey have a distaste for, and resent it as an outrage to their feelings;as a religious bigot, when charged with disregarding the religiousfeelings of others, has been known to retort that they disregard hisfeelings, by persisting in their abominable worship or creed end_token but thereis no parity between the feeling of a person for his own opinion, andthe feeling of another who is offended at his holding it; no more thanbetween the desire of a thief to take a purse, and the desire of theright owner to keep it end_token and a person's taste is as much his own peculiarconcern as his opinion or his purse end_token it is easy for any one to imaginean ideal public, which leaves the freedom and choice of individuals inall uncertain matters undisturbed, and only requires them to abstainfrom modes of conduct which universal experience has condemned end_token butwhere has there been seen a public which set any such limit to itscensorship? or when does the public trouble itself about universalexperience? in its interferences with personal conduct it is seldomthinking of anything but the enormity of acting or feeling differentlyfrom itself; and this standard of judgment, thinly disguised, is held upto mankind as the dictate of religion and philosophy, by nine-tenths ofall moralists and speculative writers end_token these teach that things are rightbecause they are right; because we feel them to be so end_token they tell us tosearch in our own minds and hearts for laws of conduct binding onourselves and on all others end_token what can the poor public do but apply theseinstructions, and make their own personal feelings of good and evil, ifthey are tolerably unanimous in them, obligatory on all the world?the evil here pointed out is not one which exists only in theory; and itmay perhaps be expected that i should specify the instances in which thepublic of this age and country improperly invests its own preferenceswith the character of moral laws end_token i am not writing an essay on theaberrations of existing moral feeling end_token that is too weighty a subject tobe discussed parenthetically, and by way of illustration end_token yet examplesare necessary, to show that the principle i maintain is of serious andpractical moment, and that i am not endeavouring to erect a barrieragainst imaginary evils end_token and it is not difficult to show, by abundantinstances, that to extend the bounds of what may be called moral police,until it encroaches on the most unquestionably legitimate liberty of theindividual, is one of the most universal of all human propensities end_tokenas a first instance, consider the antipathies which men cherish on nobetter grounds than that persons whose religious opinions are differentfrom theirs, do not practise their religious observances, especiallytheir religious abstinences end_token to cite a rather trivial example, nothingin the creed or practice of christians does more to envenom the hatredof mahomedans against them, than the fact of their eating pork end_token thereare few acts which christians and europeans regard with more unaffecteddisgust, than mussulmans regard this particular mode of satisfyinghunger end_token it is, in the first place, an offence against their religion;but this circumstance by no means explains either the degree or the kindof their repugnance;

and no otherpublic worship is lawful on spanish soil end_token the people of all southerneurope look upon a married clergy as not only irreligious, but unchaste,indecent, gross, disgusting end_token what do protestants think of theseperfectly sincere feelings, and of the attempt to enforce them againstnon-catholics? yet, if mankind are justified in interfering with eachother's liberty in things which do not concern the interests of others,on what principle is it possible consistently to exclude these cases? orwho can blame people for desiring to suppress what they regard as ascandal in the sight of god and man? no stronger case can be shown forprohibiting anything which is regarded as a personal immorality, thanis made out for suppressing these practices in the eyes of those whoregard them as impieties; and unless we are willing to adopt the logicof persecutors, and to say that we may persecute others because we areright, and that they must not persecute us because they are wrong, wemust beware of admitting a principle of which we should resent as agross injustice the application to ourselves end_tokenthe preceding instances may be objected to, although unreasonably, asdrawn from contingencies impossible among us: opinion, in this country,not being likely to enforce abstinence from meats, or to interfere withpeople for worshipping, and for either marrying or not marrying,according to their creed or inclination end_token the next example, however,shall be taken from an interference with liberty which we have by nomeans passed all danger of end_token wherever the puritans have been sufficientlypowerful, as in new england, and in great britain at the time of thecommonwealth, they have endeavoured, with considerable success, to putdown all public, and nearly all private, amusements: especially music,dancing, public games, or other assemblages for purposes of diversion,and the theatre end_token there are still in this country large bodies ofpersons by whose notions of morality and religion these recreations arecondemned; and those persons belonging chiefly to the middle class, whoare the ascendant power in the present social and political condition ofthe kingdom, it is by no means impossible that persons of thesesentiments may at some time or other command a majority in parliament end_tokenhow will the remaining portion of the community like to have theamusements that shall be permitted to them regulated by the religiousand moral sentiments of the stricter calvinists and methodists? wouldthey not, with considerable peremptoriness, desire these intrusivelypious members of society to mind their own business? this is preciselywhat should be said to every government and every public, who have thepretension that no person shall enjoy any pleasure which they thinkwrong end_token but if the principle of the pretension be admitted, no one canreasonably object to its being acted on in the sense of the majority, orother preponderating power in the country; and all persons must be readyto conform to the idea of a christian commonwealth, as understood by theearly settlers in new england, if a religious profession similar totheirs should ever succeed in regaining its lost ground, as religionssupposed to be declining have so often been known to do end_tokento imagine another contingency, perhaps more likely to be realised thanthe one last mentioned end_token there is confessedly a strong tendency in themodern world towards a democratic constitution of society, accompaniedor not by popular political institutions end_token it is affirmed that in thecountry where this tendency is most completely realised--where bothsociety and the government are most democratic--the united states--thefeeling of the majority, to whom any appearance of a more showy orcostly style of living than they can hope to rival is disagreeable,operates as a tolerably effectual sumptuary law, and that in many partsof the union it is really difficult for a person possessing a very largeincome, to find any mode of spending it, which will not incur populardisapprobation end_token though such statements as these are doubtless muchexaggerated as a representation of existing facts, the state of thingsthey describe is not only a conceivable and possible, but a probableresult of democratic feeling, combined with the notion that the publichas a right to a veto on the manner in which individuals shall spendtheir incomes end_token we have only further to suppose a considerable diffusionof socialist opinions, and it may become infamous in the eyes of themajority to possess more property than some very small amount, or anyincome not earned by manual labour end_token opinions similar in principle tothese, already prevail widely among the artisan class, and weighoppressively on those who are amenable to the opinion chiefly of thatclass, namely, its own members end_token it is known that the bad workmen whoform the majority of the operatives in many branches of industry, aredecidedly of opinion that bad workmen ought to receive the same wages asgood, and that no one ought to be allowed, through piecework orotherwise, to earn by superior skill or industry more than others canwithout it end_token and they employ a moral police, which occasionally becomes aphysical one, to deter skilful workmen from receiving, and employersfrom giving, a larger remuneration for a more useful service end_token if thepublic have any jurisdiction over private concerns, i cannot see thatthese people are in fault, or that any individual's particular publiccan be blamed for asserting the same authority over his individualconduct, which the general public asserts over people in general end_tokenbut, without dwelling upon supposititious cases, there are, in our ownday, gross usurpations upon the liberty of private life actuallypractised, and still greater ones threatened with some expectation ofsuccess, and opinions proposed which assert an unlimited right in thepublic not only to prohibit by law everything which it thinks wrong, butin order to get at what it thinks wrong, to prohibit any number ofthings which it admits to be innocent end_tokenunder the name of preventing intemperance, the people of one englishcolony, and of nearly half the united states, have been interdicted bylaw from making any use whatever of fermented drinks, except for medicalpurposes: for prohibition of their sale is in fact, as it is intended tobe, prohibition of their use end_token and though the impracticability ofexecuting the law has caused its repeal in several of the states whichhad adopted it, including the one from which it derives its name, anattempt has notwithstanding been commenced, and is prosecuted withconsiderable zeal by many of the professed philanthropists, to agitatefor a similar law in this country end_token the association, or \"alliance\" as itterms itself, which has been formed for this purpose, has acquired somenotoriety through the publicity given to a correspondence between itssecretary and one of the very few english public men who hold that apolitician's opinions ought to be founded on principles end_token lord stanley'sshare in this correspondence is calculated to strengthen the hopesalready built on him, by those who know how rare such qualities as aremanifested in some of his public appearances, unhappily are among thosewho figure in political life end_token the organ of the alliance, who would\"deeply deplore the recognition of any principle which could be wrestedto justify bigotry and persecution,\" undertakes to point out the \"broadand impassable barrier\" which divides such principles from those of theassociation end_token \"all matters relating to thought, opinion, conscience,appear to me,\" he says, \"to be without the sphere of legislation;

there is no violation of liberty which it would not justify;it acknowledges no right to any freedom whatever, except perhaps to thatof holding opinions in secret, without ever disclosing them: for themoment an opinion which i consider noxious, passes any one's lips, itinvades all the \"social rights\" attributed to me by the alliance end_token thedoctrine ascribes to all mankind a vested interest in each other'smoral, intellectual, and even physical perfection, to be defined by eachclaimant according to his own standard end_tokenanother important example of illegitimate interference with the rightfulliberty of the individual, not simply threatened, but long since carriedinto triumphant effect, is sabbatarian legislation end_token without doubt,abstinence on one day in the week, so far as the exigencies of lifepermit, from the usual daily occupation, though in no respectreligiously binding on any except jews, is a highly beneficial custom end_tokenand inasmuch as this custom cannot be observed without a general consentto that effect among the industrious classes, therefore, in so far assome persons by working may impose the same necessity on others, it maybe allowable and right that the law should guarantee to each, theobservance by others of the custom, by suspending the greater operationsof industry on a particular day end_token but this justification, grounded on thedirect interest which others have in each individual's observance ofthe practice, does not apply to the self-chosen occupations in which aperson may think fit to employ his leisure; nor does it hold good, inthe smallest degree, for legal restrictions on amusements end_token it is truethat the amusement of some is the day's work of others; but thepleasure, not to say the useful recreation, of many, is worth the labourof a few, provided the occupation is freely chosen, and can be freelyresigned end_token the operatives are perfectly right in thinking that if allworked on sunday, seven days' work would have to be given for six days'wages: but so long as the great mass of employments are suspended, thesmall number who for the enjoyment of others must still work, obtain aproportional increase of earnings; and they are not obliged to followthose occupations, if they prefer leisure to emolument end_token if a furtherremedy is sought, it might be found in the establishment by custom of aholiday on some other day of the week for those particular classes ofpersons end_token the only ground, therefore, on which restrictions on sundayamusements can be defended, must be that they are religiously wrong; amotive of legislation which never can be too earnestly protestedagainst end_token \"deorum injuriã¦ diis curã¦ end_token\" it remains to be proved thatsociety or any of its officers holds a commission from on high toavenge any supposed offence to omnipotence, which is not also a wrong toour fellow-creatures end_token the notion that it is one man's duty that anothershould be religious, was the foundation of all the religiouspersecutions ever perpetrated, and if admitted, would fully justifythem end_token though the feeling which breaks out in the repeated attempts tostop railway travelling on sunday, in the resistance to the opening ofmuseums, and the like, has not the cruelty of the old persecutors, thestate of mind indicated by it is fundamentally the same end_token it is adetermination not to tolerate others in doing what is permitted by theirreligion, because it is not permitted by the persecutor's religion end_token itis a belief that god not only abominates the act of the misbeliever, butwill not hold us guiltless if we leave him unmolested end_tokeni cannot refrain from adding to these examples of the little accountcommonly made of human liberty, the language of downright persecutionwhich breaks out from the press of this country, whenever it feelscalled on to notice the remarkable phenomenon of mormonism end_token much mightbe said on the unexpected and instructive fact, that an alleged newrevelation, and a religion founded on it, the product of palpableimposture, not even supported by the prestige of extraordinaryqualities in its founder, is believed by hundreds of thousands, and hasbeen made the foundation of a society, in the age of newspapers,railways, and the electric telegraph end_token what here concerns us is, thatthis religion, like other and better religions, has its martyrs; thatits prophet and founder was, for his teaching, put to death by a mob;that others of its adherents lost their lives by the same lawlessviolence; that they were forcibly expelled, in a body, from the countryin which they first grew up; while, now that they have been chased intoa solitary recess in the midst of a desert, many in this country openlydeclare that it would be right (only that it is not convenient) to sendan expedition against them, and compel them by force to conform to theopinions of other people end_token the article of the mormonite doctrine which isthe chief provocative to the antipathy which thus breaks through theordinary restraints of religious tolerance, is its sanction of polygamy;which, though permitted to mahomedans, and hindoos, and chinese, seemsto excite unquenchable animosity when practised by persons who speakenglish, and profess to be a kind of christians end_token no one has a deeperdisapprobation than i have of this mormon institution; both for otherreasons, and because, far from being in any way countenanced by theprinciple of liberty, it is a direct infraction of that principle, beinga mere riveting of the chains of one half of the community, and anemancipation of the other from reciprocity of obligation towards them end_tokenstill, it must be remembered that this relation is as much voluntary onthe part of the women concerned in it, and who may be deemed thesufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of the marriageinstitution; and however surprising this fact may appear, it has itsexplanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, which teachingwomen to think marriage the one thing needful, make it intelligible thatmany a woman should prefer being one of several wives, to not being awife at all end_token other countries are not asked to recognise such unions, orrelease any portion of their inhabitants from their own laws on thescore of mormonite opinions end_token but when the dissentients have conceded tothe hostile sentiments of others, far more than could justly bedemanded; when they have left the countries to which their doctrineswere unacceptable, and established themselves in a remote corner of theearth, which they have been the first to render habitable to humanbeings; it is difficult to see on what principles but those of tyrannythey can be prevented from living there under what laws they please,provided they commit no aggression on other nations, and allow perfectfreedom of departure to those who are dissatisfied with their ways end_token arecent writer, in some respects of considerable merit, proposes (to usehis own words), not a crusade, but a _civilizade_, against thispolygamous community, to put an end to what seems to him a retrogradestep in civilisation end_token it also appears so to me, but i am not aware thatany community has a right to force another to be civilised end_token so long asthe sufferers by the bad law do not invoke assistance from othercommunities, i cannot admit that persons entirely unconnected with themought to step in and require that a condition of things with which allwho are directly interested appear to be satisfied, should be put an endto because it is a scandal to persons some thousands of miles distant,who have no part or concern in it end_token let them send missionaries, if theyplease, to preach against it; and let them, by any fair means (of whichsilencing the teachers is not one), oppose the progress of similardoctrines among their own people end_token if civilisation has got the better ofbarbarism when barbarism had the world to itself, it is too much toprofess to be afraid lest barbarism, after having been fairly got under,should revive and conquer civilisation end_token a civilisation that can thussuccumb to its vanquished enemy, must first have become so degenerate,that neither its appointed priests and teachers, nor anybody else, hasthe capacity, or will take the trouble, to stand up for it end_token if this beso, the sooner such a civilisation receives notice to quit, the better end_tokenit can only go on from bad to worse, until destroyed and regenerated(like the western empire) by energetic barbarians end_tokenthe case of the bombay parsees is a curious instance in point end_token whenthis industrious and enterprising tribe, the descendants of the persianfire-worshippers, flying from their native country before the caliphs,arrived in western india, they were admitted to toleration by the hindoosovereigns, on condition of not eating beef end_token when those regionsafterwards fell under the dominion of mahomedan conquerors, the parseesobtained from them a continuance of indulgence, on condition ofrefraining from pork end_token what was at first obedience to authority became asecond nature, and the parsees to this day abstain both from beef andpork end_token though not required by their religion, the double abstinence hashad time to grow into a custom of their tribe; and custom, in the east,is a religion end_tokenthe principles asserted in these pages must be more generally admittedas the basis for discussion of details, before a consistent applicationof them to all the various departments of government and morals can beattempted with any prospect of advantage end_token the few observations i proposeto make on questions of detail, are designed to illustrate theprinciples, rather than to follow them out to their consequences end_token ioffer, not so much applications, as specimens of application; which mayserve to bring into greater clearness the meaning and limits of the twomaxims which together form the entire doctrine of this essay, and toassist the judgment in holding the balance between them, in the caseswhere it appears doubtful which of them is applicable to the case end_tokenthe maxims are, first, that the individual is not accountable to societyfor his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no personbut himself end_token advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by otherpeople if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the onlymeasures by which society can justifiably express its dislike ordisapprobation of his conduct end_token secondly, that for such actions as areprejudicial to the interests of others, the individual is accountableand may be subjected either to social or to legal punishments, ifsociety is of opinion that the one or the other is requisite for itsprotection end_tokenin the first place, it must by no means be supposed, because damage, orprobability of damage, to the interests of others, can alone justify theinterference of society, that therefore it always does justify suchinterference end_token in many cases, an individual, in pursuing a legitimateobject, necessarily and therefore legitimately causes pain or loss toothers, or intercepts a good which they had a reasonable hope ofobtaining end_token such oppositions of interest between individuals often arisefrom bad social institutions, but are unavoidable while thoseinstitutions last; and some would be unavoidable under any institutions end_tokenwhoever succeeds in an overcrowded profession, or in a competitiveexamination; whoever is preferred to another in any contest for anobject which both desire, reaps benefit from the loss of others, fromtheir wasted exertion and their disappointment end_token but it is, by commonadmission, better for the general interest of mankind, that personsshould pursue their objects undeterred by this sort of consequences end_token inother words, society admits no rights, either legal or moral, in thedisappointed competitors, to immunity from this kind of suffering; andfeels called on to interfere, only when means of success have beenemployed which it is contrary to the general interest to permit--namely,fraud or treachery, and force end_tokenagain, trade is a social act end_token whoever undertakes to sell any descriptionof goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons,and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comeswithin the jurisdiction of society: accordingly, it was once held to bethe duty of governments, in all cases which were considered ofimportance, to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture end_tokenbut it is now recognised, though not till after a long struggle, thatboth the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are mosteffectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectlyfree, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplyingthemselves elsewhere end_token this is the so-called doctrine of free trade,which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, theprinciple of individual liberty asserted in this essay end_token restrictions ontrade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints;and all restraint, quã¢ restraint, is an evil: but the restraints inquestion affect only that part of conduct which society is competent torestrain, and are wrong solely because they do not really produce theresults which it is desired to produce by them end_token as the principle ofindividual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of free trade, soneither is it in most of the questions which arise respecting the limitsof that doctrine: as for example, what amount of public control isadmissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitaryprecautions, or arrangements to protect work-people employed indangerous occupations, should be enforced on employers end_token such questionsinvolve considerations of liberty, only in so far as leaving people tothemselves is always better, _cã¦teris paribus_, than controlling them:but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is inprinciple undeniable end_token on the other hand, there are questions relating tointerference with trade, which are essentially questions of liberty;such as the maine law, already touched upon; the prohibition of theimportation of opium into china; the restriction of the sale of poisons;all cases, in short, where the object of the interference is to make itimpossible or difficult to obtain a particular commodity end_token theseinterferences are objectionable, not as infringements on the liberty ofthe producer or seller, but on that of the buyer end_tokenone of these examples, that of the sale of poisons, opens a newquestion; the proper limits of what may be called the functions ofpolice; how far liberty may legitimately be invaded for the preventionof crime, or of accident end_token it is one of the undisputed functions ofgovernment to take precautions against crime before it has beencommitted, as well as to detect and punish it afterwards end_token the preventivefunction of government, however, is far more liable to be abused, to theprejudice of liberty, than the punitory function; for there is hardlyany part of the legitimate freedom of action of a human being whichwould not admit of being represented, and fairly too, as increasing thefacilities for some form or other of delinquency end_token nevertheless, if apublic authority, or even a private person, sees any one evidentlypreparing to commit a crime, they are not bound to look on inactiveuntil the crime is committed, but may interfere to prevent it end_token ifpoisons were never bought or used for any purpose except the commissionof murder, it would be right to prohibit their manufacture and sale end_tokenthey may, however, be wanted not only for innocent but for usefulpurposes, and restrictions cannot be imposed in the one case withoutoperating in the other end_token again, it is a proper office of public authorityto guard against accidents end_token if either a public officer or any one elsesaw a person attempting to cross a bridge which had been ascertained tobe unsafe, and there were no time to warn him of his danger, they mightseize him and turn him back, without any real infringement of hisliberty; for liberty consists in doing what one desires, and he does notdesire to fall into the river end_token nevertheless, when there is not acertainty, but only a danger of mischief, no one but the person himselfcan judge of the sufficiency of the motive which may prompt him to incurthe risk: in this case, therefore (unless he is a child, or delirious,or in some state of excitement or absorption incompatible with the fulluse of the reflecting faculty), he ought, i conceive, to be only warnedof the danger; not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it end_tokensimilar considerations, applied to such a question as the sale ofpoisons, may enable us to decide which among the possible modes ofregulation are or are not contrary to principle end_token such a precaution, forexample, as that of labelling the drug with some word expressive of itsdangerous character, may be enforced without violation of liberty: thebuyer cannot wish not to know that the thing he possesses has poisonousqualities end_token but to require in all cases the certificate of a medicalpractitioner, would make it sometimes impossible, always expensive, toobtain the article for legitimate uses end_token the only mode apparent to me, inwhich difficulties may be thrown in the way of crime committed throughthis means, without any infringement, worth taking into account, uponthe liberty of those who desire the poisonous substance for otherpurposes, consists in providing what, in the apt language of bentham, iscalled \"preappointed evidence end_token\" this provision is familiar to every onein the case of contracts end_token it is usual and right that the law, when acontract is entered into, should require as the condition of itsenforcing performance, that certain formalities should be observed, suchas signatures, attestation of witnesses, and the like, in order that incase of subsequent dispute, there may be evidence to prove that thecontract was really entered into, and that there was nothing in thecircumstances to render it legally invalid: the effect being, to throwgreat obstacles in the way of fictitious contracts, or contracts made incircumstances which, if known, would destroy their validity end_token precautionsof a similar nature might be enforced in the sale of articles adapted tobe instruments of crime end_token the seller, for example, might be required toenter into a register the exact time of the transaction, the name andaddress of the buyer, the precise quality and quantity sold; to ask thepurpose for which it was wanted, and record the answer he received end_token whenthere was no medical prescription, the presence of some third personmight be required, to bring home the fact to the purchaser, in casethere should afterwards be reason to believe that the article had beenapplied to criminal purposes end_token such regulations would in general be nomaterial impediment to obtaining the article, but a very considerableone to making an improper use of it without detection end_tokenthe right inherent in society, to ward off crimes against itself byantecedent precautions, suggests the obvious limitations to the maxim,that purely self-regarding misconduct cannot properly be meddled within the way of prevention or punishment end_token drunkenness, for example, inordinary cases, is not a fit subject for legislative interference; but ishould deem it perfectly legitimate that a person, who had once beenconvicted of any act of violence to others under the influence of drink,should be placed under a special legal restriction, personal to himself;that if he were afterwards found drunk, he should be liable to apenalty, and that if when in that state he committed another offence,the punishment to which he would be liable for that other offence shouldbe increased in severity end_token the making himself drunk, in a person whomdrunkenness excites to do harm to others, is a crime against others end_token so,again, idleness, except in a person receiving support from the public,or except when it constitutes a breach of contract, cannot withouttyranny be made a subject of legal punishment; but if either fromidleness or from any other avoidable cause, a man fails to perform hislegal duties to others, as for instance to support his children, it isno tyranny to force him to fulfil that obligation, by compulsory labour,if no other means are available end_tokenagain, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to theagents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which, ifdone publicly, are a violation of good manners and coming thus withinthe category of offences against others may rightfully be prohibited end_token ofthis kind are offences against decency; on which it is unnecessary todwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with oursubject, the objection to publicity being equally strong in the case ofmany actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be so end_tokenthere is another question to which an answer must be found, consistentwith the principles which have been laid down end_token in cases of personalconduct supposed to be blamable, but which respect for liberty precludessociety from preventing or punishing, because the evil directlyresulting falls wholly on the agent; what the agent is free to do, oughtother persons to be equally free to counsel or instigate? this questionis not free from difficulty end_token the case of a person who solicits anotherto do an act, is not strictly a case of self-regarding conduct end_token to giveadvice or offer inducements to any one, is a social act, and maytherefore, like actions in general which affect others, be supposedamenable to social control end_token but a little reflection corrects the firstimpression, by showing that if the case is not strictly within thedefinition of individual liberty, yet the reasons on which theprinciple of individual liberty is grounded, are applicable to it end_token ifpeople must be allowed, in whatever concerns only themselves, to act asseems best to themselves at their own peril, they must equally be freeto consult with one another about what is fit to be so done; to exchangeopinions, and give and receive suggestions end_token whatever it is permitted todo, it must be permitted to advise to do end_token the question is doubtful, onlywhen the instigator derives a personal benefit from his advice; when hemakes it his occupation, for subsistence or pecuniary gain, to promotewhat society and the state consider to be an evil end_token then, indeed, a newelement of complication is introduced; namely, the existence of classesof persons with an interest opposed to what is considered as the publicweal, and whose mode of living is grounded on the counteraction of it end_tokenought this to be interfered with, or not? fornication, for example, mustbe tolerated, and so must gambling; but should a person be free to be apimp, or to keep a gambling-house? the case is one of those which lie onthe exact boundary line between two principles, and it is not at onceapparent to which of the two it properly belongs end_token there are arguments onboth sides end_token on the side of toleration it may be said, that the fact offollowing anything as an occupation, and living or profiting by thepractice of it, cannot make that criminal which would otherwise beadmissible; that the act should either be consistently permitted orconsistently prohibited; that if the principles which we have hithertodefended are true, society has no business, as society, to decideanything to be wrong which concerns only the individual; that it cannotgo beyond dissuasion, and that one person should be as free to persuade,as another to dissuade end_token in opposition to this it may be contended, thatalthough the public, or the state, are not warranted in authoritativelydeciding, for purposes of repression or punishment, that such or suchconduct affecting only the interests of the individual is good or bad,they are fully justified in assuming, if they regard it as bad, that itsbeing so or not is at least a disputable question: that, this beingsupposed, they cannot be acting wrongly in endeavouring to exclude theinfluence of solicitations which are not disinterested, of instigatorswho cannot possibly be impartial--who have a direct personal interest onone side, and that side the one which the state believes to be wrong,and who confessedly promote it for personal objects only end_token there cansurely, it may be urged, be nothing lost, no sacrifice of good, by soordering matters that persons shall make their election, either wiselyor foolishly, on their own prompting, as free as possible from the artsof persons who stimulate their inclinations for interested purposes oftheir own end_token thus (it may be said) though the statutes respecting unlawfulgames are utterly indefensible--though all persons should be free togamble in their own or each other's houses, or in any place of meetingestablished by their own subscriptions, and open only to the members andtheir visitors--yet public gambling-houses should not be permitted end_token itis true that the prohibition is never effectual, and that whateveramount of tyrannical power is given to the police, gambling-houses canalways be maintained under other pretences; but they may be compelled toconduct their operations with a certain degree of secrecy and mystery,so that nobody knows anything about them but those who seek them; andmore than this, society ought not to aim at end_token there is considerable forcein these arguments; i will not venture to decide whether they aresufficient to justify the moral anomaly of punishing the accessary, whenthe principal is (and must be) allowed to go free; or fining orimprisoning the procurer, but not the fornicator, the gambling-housekeeper, but not the gambler end_token still less ought the common operations ofbuying and selling to be interfered with on analogous grounds end_token almostevery article which is bought and sold may be used in excess, and thesellers have a pecuniary interest in encouraging that excess; but noargument can be founded on this, in favour, for instance, of the mainelaw; because the class of dealers in strong drinks, though interested intheir abuse, are indispensably required for the sake of their legitimateuse end_token the interest, however, of these dealers in promoting intemperanceis a real evil, and justifies the state in imposing restrictions andrequiring guarantees, which but for that justification would beinfringements of legitimate liberty end_tokena further question is, whether the state, while it permits, shouldnevertheless indirectly discourage conduct which it deems contrary tothe best interests of the agent; whether, for example, it should takemeasures to render the means of drunkenness more costly, or add to thedifficulty of procuring them, by limiting the number of the places ofsale end_token on this as on most other practical questions, many distinctionsrequire to be made end_token to tax stimulants for the sole purpose of makingthem more difficult to be obtained, is a measure differing only indegree from their entire prohibition; and would be justifiable only ifthat were justifiable end_token every increase of cost is a prohibition, to thosewhose means do not come up to the augmented price; and to those who do,it is a penalty laid on them for gratifying a particular taste end_token theirchoice of pleasures, and their mode of expending their income, aftersatisfying their legal and moral obligations to the state and toindividuals, are their own concern, and must rest with their ownjudgment end_token these considerations may seem at first sight to condemn theselection of stimulants as special subjects of taxation for purposes ofrevenue end_token but it must be remembered that taxation for fiscal purposes isabsolutely inevitable; that in most countries it is necessary that aconsiderable part of that taxation should be indirect; that the state,therefore, cannot help imposing penalties, which to some persons may beprohibitory, on the use of some articles of consumption end_token it is hence theduty of the state to consider, in the imposition of taxes, whatcommodities the consumers can best spare; and _ã fortiori_, to select inpreference those of which it deems the use, beyond a very moderatequantity, to be positively injurious end_token taxation, therefore, ofstimulants, up to the point which produces the largest amount of revenue(supposing that the state needs all the revenue which it yields) is notonly admissible, but to be approved of end_tokenthe question of making the sale of these commodities a more or lessexclusive privilege, must be answered differently, according to thepurposes to which the restriction is intended to be subservient end_token allplaces of public resort require the restraint of a police, and places ofthis kind peculiarly, because offences against society are especiallyapt to originate there end_token it is, therefore, fit to confine the power ofselling these commodities (at least for consumption on the spot) topersons of known or vouched-for respectability of conduct; to make suchregulations respecting hours of opening and closing as may be requisitefor public surveillance, and to withdraw the licence if breaches of thepeace repeatedly take place through the connivance or incapacity of thekeeper of the house, or if it becomes a rendezvous for concocting andpreparing offences against the law end_token any further restriction i do notconceive to be, in principle, justifiable end_token the limitation in number, forinstance, of beer and spirit-houses, for the express purpose ofrendering them more difficult of access, and diminishing the occasionsof temptation, not only exposes all to an inconvenience because thereare some by whom the facility would be abused, but is suited only to astate of society in which the labouring classes are avowedly treated aschildren or savages, and placed under an education of restraint, to fitthem for future admission to the privileges of freedom end_token this is not theprinciple on which the labouring classes are professedly governed in anyfree country; and no person who sets due value on freedom will give hisadhesion to their being so governed, unless after all efforts have beenexhausted to educate them for freedom and govern them as freemen, and ithas been definitively proved that they can only be governed as children end_tokenthe bare statement of the alternative shows the absurdity of supposingthat such efforts have been made in any case which needs be consideredhere end_token it is only because the institutions of this country are a mass ofinconsistencies, that things find admittance into our practice whichbelong to the system of despotic, or what is called paternal,government, while the general freedom of our institutions precludes theexercise of the amount of control necessary to render the restraint ofany real efficacy as a moral education end_tokenit was pointed out in an early part of this essay, that the liberty ofthe individual, in things wherein the individual is alone concerned,implies a corresponding liberty in any number of individuals to regulateby mutual agreement such things as regard them jointly, and regard nopersons but themselves end_token this question presents no difficulty, so long asthe will of all the persons implicated remains unaltered; but since thatwill may change, it is often necessary, even in things in which theyalone are concerned, that they should enter into engagements with oneanother; and when they do, it is fit, as a general rule, that thoseengagements should be kept end_token yet in the laws, probably, of every country,this general rule has some exceptions end_token not only persons are not held toengagements which violate the rights of third parties, but it issometimes considered a sufficient reason for releasing them from anengagement, that it is injurious to themselves end_token in this and most othercivilised countries, for example, an engagement by which a person shouldsell himself, or allow himself to be sold, as a slave, would be null andvoid; neither enforced by law nor by opinion end_token the ground for thuslimiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in life, isapparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case end_token the reason fornot interfering, unless for the sake of others, with a person'svoluntary acts, is consideration for his liberty end_token his voluntary choiceis evidence that what he so chooses is desirable, or at the leastendurable, to him, and his good is on the whole best provided for byallowing him to take his own means of pursuing it end_token but by sellinghimself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty; he foregoes any futureuse of it, beyond that single act end_token he therefore defeats, in his owncase, the very purpose which is the justification of allowing him todispose of himself end_token he is no longer free; but is thenceforth in aposition which has no longer the presumption in its favour, that wouldbe afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it end_token the principle of freedomcannot require that he should be free not to be free end_token it is not freedom,to be allowed to alienate his freedom end_token these reasons, the force of whichis so conspicuous in this peculiar case, are evidently of far widerapplication; yet a limit is everywhere set to them by the necessities oflife, which continually require, not indeed that we should resign ourfreedom, but that we should consent to this and the other limitation ofit end_token the principle, however, which demands uncontrolled freedom of actionin all that concerns only the agents themselves, requires that those whohave become bound to one another, in things which concern no thirdparty, should be able to release one another from the engagement: andeven without such voluntary release, there are perhaps no contracts orengagements, except those that relate to money or money's worth, ofwhich one can venture to say that there ought to be no liberty whateverof retractation end_token baron wilhelm von humboldt, in the excellent essay fromwhich i have already quoted, states it as his conviction, thatengagements which involve personal relations or services, should neverbe legally binding beyond a limited duration of time; and that the mostimportant of these engagements, marriage, having the peculiarity thatits objects are frustrated unless the feelings of both the parties arein harmony with it, should require nothing more than the declared willof either party to dissolve it end_token this subject is too important, and toocomplicated, to be discussed in a parenthesis, and i touch on it only sofar as is necessary for purposes of illustration end_token if the conciseness andgenerality of baron humboldt's dissertation had not obliged him in thisinstance to content himself with enunciating his conclusion withoutdiscussing the premises, he would doubtless have recognised that thequestion cannot be decided on grounds so simple as those to which heconfines himself end_token when a person, either by express promise or byconduct, has encouraged another to rely upon his continuing to act in acertain way--to build expectations and calculations, and stake any partof his plan of life upon that supposition, a new series of moralobligations arises on his part towards that person, which may possiblybe overruled, but cannot be ignored end_token and again, if the relation betweentwo contracting parties has been followed by consequences to others; ifit has placed third parties in any peculiar position, or, as in the caseof marriage, has even called third parties into existence, obligationsarise on the part of both the contracting parties towards those thirdpersons, the fulfilment of which, or at all events the mode offulfilment, must be greatly affected by the continuance or disruption ofthe relation between the original parties to the contract end_token it does notfollow, nor can i admit, that these obligations extend to requiring thefulfilment of the contract at all costs to the happiness of thereluctant party; but they are a necessary element in the question; andeven if, as von humboldt maintains, they ought to make no difference inthe legal freedom of the parties to release themselves from theengagement (and i also hold that they ought not to make muchdifference), they necessarily make a great difference in the moralfreedom end_token a person is bound to take all these circumstances into account,before resolving on a step which may affect such important interests ofothers; and if he does not allow proper weight to those interests, he ismorally responsible for the wrong end_token i have made these obvious remarks forthe better illustration of the general principle of liberty, and notbecause they are at all needed on the particular question, which, on thecontrary, is usually discussed as if the interest of children waseverything, and that of grown persons nothing end_tokeni have already observed that, owing to the absence of any recognisedgeneral principles, liberty is often granted where it should bewithheld, as well as withheld where it should be granted; and one of thecases in which, in the modern european world, the sentiment of libertyis the strongest, is a case where, in my view, it is altogethermisplaced end_token a person should be free to do as he likes in his ownconcerns; but he ought not to be free to do as he likes in acting foranother, under the pretext that the affairs of another are his ownaffairs end_token the state, while it respects the liberty of each in whatspecially regards himself, is bound to maintain a vigilant control overhis exercise of any power which it allows him to possess over others end_tokenthis obligation is almost entirely disregarded in the case of thefamily relations, a case, in its direct influence on human happiness,more important than all others taken together end_token the almost despotic powerof husbands over wives need not be enlarged upon here because nothingmore is needed for the complete removal of the evil, than that wivesshould have the same rights, and should receive the protection of law inthe same manner, as all other persons; and because, on this subject, thedefenders of established injustice do not avail themselves of the pleaof liberty, but stand forth openly as the champions of power end_token it is inthe case of children, that misapplied notions of liberty are a realobstacle to the fulfilment by the state of its duties end_token one would almostthink that a man's children were supposed to be literally, and notmetaphorically, a part of himself, so jealous is opinion of the smallestinterference of law with his absolute and exclusive control over them;more jealous than of almost any interference with his own freedom ofaction: so much less do the generality of mankind value liberty thanpower end_token consider, for example, the case of education end_token is it not almost aself-evident axiom, that the state should require and compel theeducation, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is bornits citizen? yet who is there that is not afraid to recognise andassert this truth? hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of themost sacred duties of the parents (or, as law and usage now stand, thefather), after summoning a human being into the world, to give to thatbeing an education fitting him to perform his part well in life towardsothers and towards himself end_token but while this is unanimously declared to bethe father's duty, scarcely anybody, in this country, will bear to hearof obliging him to perform it end_token instead of his being required to make anyexertion or sacrifice for securing education to the child, it is left tohis choice to accept it or not when it is provided gratis! it stillremains unrecognised, that to bring a child into existence without afair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, butinstruction and training for its mind, is a moral crime, both againstthe unfortunate offspring and against society; and that if the parentdoes not fulfil this obligation, the state ought to see it fulfilled, atthe charge, as far as possible, of the parent end_tokenwere the duty of enforcing universal education once admitted, therewould be an end to the difficulties about what the state should teach,and how it should teach, which now convert the subject into a merebattle-field for sects and parties, causing the time and labour whichshould have been spent in educating, to be wasted in quarrelling abouteducation end_token if the government would make up its mind to require forevery child a good education, it might save itself the trouble ofproviding one end_token it might leave to parents to obtain the education whereand how they pleased, and content itself with helping to pay the schoolfees of the poorer class of children, and defraying the entire schoolexpenses of those who have no one else to pay for them end_token the objectionswhich are urged with reason against state education, do not apply to theenforcement of education by the state, but to the state's taking uponitself to direct that education; which is a totally different thing end_tokenthat the whole or any large part of the education of the people shouldbe in state hands, i go as far as any one in deprecating end_token all that hasbeen said of the importance of individuality of character, and diversityin opinions and modes of conduct, involves, as of the same unspeakableimportance, diversity of education end_token a general state education is a merecontrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another; and asthe mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominantpower in the government, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, anaristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation, in proportionas it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over themind, leading by natural tendency to one over the body end_token an educationestablished and controlled by the state, should only exist, if it existat all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for thepurpose of example and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certainstandard of excellence end_token unless, indeed, when society in general is in sobackward a state that it could not or would not provide for itself anyproper institutions of education, unless the government undertook thetask; then, indeed, the government may, as the less of two great evils,take upon itself the business of schools and universities, as it maythat of joint stock companies, when private enterprise, in a shapefitted for undertaking great works of industry, does not exist in thecountry end_token but in general, if the country contains a sufficient number ofpersons qualified to provide education under government auspices, thesame persons would be able and willing to give an equally good educationon the voluntary principle, under the assurance of remuneration affordedby a law rendering education compulsory, combined with state aid tothose unable to defray the expense end_tokenthe instrument for enforcing the law could be no other than publicexaminations, extending to all children, and beginning at an early age end_tokenan age might be fixed at which every child must be examined, toascertain if he (or she) is able to read end_token if a child proves unable, thefather, unless he has some sufficient ground of excuse, might besubjected to a moderate fine, to be worked out, if necessary, by hislabour, and the child might be put to school at his expense end_token once inevery year the examination should be renewed, with a gradually extendingrange of subjects, so as to make the universal acquisition, and what ismore, retention, of a certain minimum of general knowledge, virtuallycompulsory end_token beyond that minimum, there should be voluntary examinationson all subjects, at which all who come up to a certain standard ofproficiency might claim a certificate end_token to prevent the state fromexercising, through these arrangements, an improper influence overopinion, the knowledge required for passing an examination (beyond themerely instrumental parts of knowledge, such as languages and their use)should, even in the higher class of examinations, be confined to factsand positive science exclusively end_token the examinations on religion,politics, or other disputed topics, should not turn on the truth orfalsehood of opinions, but on the matter of fact that such and such anopinion is held, on such grounds, by such authors, or schools, orchurches end_token under this system, the rising generation would be no worse offin regard to all disputed truths, than they are at present; they wouldbe brought up either churchmen or dissenters as they now are, the statemerely taking care that they should be instructed churchmen, orinstructed dissenters end_token there would be nothing to hinder them from beingtaught religion, if their parents chose, at the same schools where theywere taught other things end_token all attempts by the state to bias theconclusions of its citizens on disputed subjects, are evil; but it mayvery properly offer to ascertain and certify that a person possesses theknowledge, requisite to make his conclusions, on any given subject,worth attending to end_token a student of philosophy would be the better forbeing able to stand an examination both in locke and in kant, whicheverof the two he takes up with, or even if with neither: and there is noreasonable objection to examining an atheist in the evidences ofchristianity, provided he is not required to profess a belief in them end_tokenthe examinations, however, in the higher branches of knowledge should, iconceive, be entirely voluntary end_token it would be giving too dangerous apower to governments, were they allowed to exclude any one fromprofessions, even from the profession of teacher, for alleged deficiencyof qualifications: and i think, with wilhelm von humboldt, that degrees,or other public certificates of scientific or professional acquirements,should be given to all who present themselves for examination, and standthe test; but that such certificates should confer no advantage overcompetitors, other than the weight which may be attached to theirtestimony by public opinion end_tokenit is not in the matter of education only, that misplaced notions ofliberty prevent moral obligations on the part of parents from beingrecognised, and legal obligations from being imposed, where there arethe strongest grounds for the former always, and in many cases for thelatter also end_token the fact itself, of causing the existence of a human being,is one of the most responsible actions in the range of human life end_token toundertake this responsibility--to bestow a life which may be either acurse or a blessing--unless the being on whom it is to be bestowed willhave at least the ordinary chances of a desirable existence, is a crimeagainst that being end_token and in a country either over-peopled, or threatenedwith being so, to produce children, beyond a very small number, withthe effect of reducing the reward of labour by their competition, is aserious offence against all who live by the remuneration of theirlabour end_token the laws which, in many countries on the continent, forbidmarriage unless the parties can show that they have the means ofsupporting a family, do not exceed the legitimate powers of the state:and whether such laws be expedient or not (a question mainly dependenton local circumstances and feelings), they are not objectionable asviolations of liberty end_token such laws are interferences of the state toprohibit a mischievous act--an act injurious to others, which ought tobe a subject of reprobation, and social stigma, even when it is notdeemed expedient to superadd legal punishment end_token yet the current ideas ofliberty, which bend so easily to real infringements of the freedom ofthe individual, in things which concern only himself, would repel theattempt to put any restraint upon his inclinations when the consequenceof their indulgence is a life, or lives, of wretchedness and depravityto the offspring, with manifold evils to those sufficiently within reachto be in any way affected by their actions end_token when we compare the strangerespect of mankind for liberty, with their strange want of respect forit, we might imagine that a man had an indispensable right to do harmto others, and no right at all to please himself without giving pain toany one end_tokeni have reserved for the last place a large class of questions respectingthe limits of government interference, which, though closely connectedwith the subject of this essay, do not, in strictness, belong to it end_tokenthese are cases in which the reasons against interference do not turnupon the principle of liberty: the question is not about restraining theactions of individuals, but about helping them: it is asked whether thegovernment should do, or cause to be done, something for their benefit,instead of leaving it to be done by themselves, individually, or involuntary combination end_tokenthe objections to government interference, when it is not such as toinvolve infringement of liberty, may be of three kinds end_tokenthe first is, when the thing to be done is likely to be better done byindividuals than by the government end_token speaking generally, there is no oneso fit to conduct any business, or to determine how or by whom it shallbe conducted, as those who are personally interested in it end_token thisprinciple condemns the interferences, once so common, of thelegislature, or the officers of government, with the ordinary processesof industry end_token but this part of the subject has been sufficiently enlargedupon by political economists, and is not particularly related to theprinciples of this essay end_tokenthe second objection is more nearly allied to our subject end_token in manycases, though individuals may not do the particular thing so well, onthe average, as the officers of government, it is nevertheless desirablethat it should be done by them, rather than by the government, as ameans to their own mental education--a mode of strengthening theiractive faculties, exercising their judgment, and giving them a familiarknowledge of the subjects with which they are thus left to deal end_token this isa principal, though not the sole, recommendation of jury trial (in casesnot political); of free and popular local and municipal institutions; ofthe conduct of industrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntaryassociations end_token these are not questions of liberty, and are connected withthat subject only by remote tendencies; but they are questions ofdevelopment end_token it belongs to a different occasion from the present todwell on these things as parts of national education; as being, intruth, the peculiar training of a citizen, the practical part of thepolitical education of a free people, taking them out of the narrowcircle of personal and family selfishness, and accustoming them to thecomprehension of joint interests, the management of jointconcerns--habituating them to act from public or semi-public motives,and guide their conduct by aims which unite instead of isolating themfrom one another end_token without these habits and powers, a free constitutioncan neither be worked nor preserved, as is exemplified by the too-oftentransitory nature of political freedom in countries where it does notrest upon a sufficient basis of local liberties end_token the management ofpurely local business by the localities, and of the great enterprises ofindustry by the union of those who voluntarily supply the pecuniarymeans, is further recommended by all the advantages which have been setforth in this essay as belonging to individuality of development, anddiversity of modes of action end_token government operations tend to beeverywhere alike end_token with individuals and voluntary associations, on thecontrary, there are varied experiments, and endless diversity ofexperience end_token what the state can usefully do, is to make itself a centraldepository, and active circulator and diffuser, of the experienceresulting from many trials end_token its business is to enable eachexperimentalist to benefit by the experiments of others, instead oftolerating no experiments but its own end_tokenthe third, and most cogent reason for restricting the interference ofgovernment, is the great evil of adding unnecessarily to its power end_tokenevery function superadded to those already exercised by the government,causes its influence over hopes and fears to be more widely diffused,and converts, more and more, the active and ambitious part of the publicinto hangers-on of the government, or of some party which aims atbecoming the government end_token if the roads, the railways, the banks, theinsurance offices, the great joint-stock companies, the universities,and the public charities, were all of them branches of the government;if, in addition, the municipal corporations and local boards, with allthat now devolves on them, became departments of the centraladministration; if the employã©s of all these different enterprises wereappointed and paid by the government, and looked to the government forevery rise in life; not all the freedom of the press and popularconstitution of the legislature would make this or any other countryfree otherwise than in name end_token and the evil would be greater, the moreefficiently and scientifically the administrative machinery wasconstructed--the more skilful the arrangements for obtaining the bestqualified hands and heads with which to work it end_token in england it has oflate been proposed that all the members of the civil service ofgovernment should be selected by competitive examination, to obtain forthose employments the most intelligent and instructed personsprocurable; and much has been said and written for and against thisproposal end_token one of the arguments most insisted on by its opponents, isthat the occupation of a permanent official servant of the state doesnot hold out sufficient prospects of emolument and importance to attractthe highest talents, which will always be able to find a more invitingcareer in the professions, or in the service of companies and otherpublic bodies end_token one would not have been surprised if this argument hadbeen used by the friends of the proposition, as an answer to itsprincipal difficulty end_token coming from the opponents it is strange enough end_tokenwhat is urged as an objection is the safety-valve of the proposedsystem end_token if indeed all the high talent of the country could be drawninto the service of the government, a proposal tending to bring aboutthat result might well inspire uneasiness end_token if every part of the businessof society which required organised concert, or large and comprehensiveviews, were in the hands of the government, and if government officeswere universally filled by the ablest men, all the enlarged culture andpractised intelligence in the country, except the purely speculative,would be concentrated in a numerous bureaucracy, to whom alone the restof the community would look for all things: the multitude for directionand dictation in all they had to do; the able and aspiring for personaladvancement end_token to be admitted into the ranks of this bureaucracy, and whenadmitted, to rise therein, would be the sole objects of ambition end_token underthis rã©gime, not only is the outside public ill-qualified, for want ofpractical experience, to criticise or check the mode of operation of thebureaucracy, but even if the accidents of despotic or the naturalworking of popular institutions occasionally raise to the summit a ruleror rulers of reforming inclinations, no reform can be effected which iscontrary to the interest of the bureaucracy end_token such is the melancholycondition of the russian empire, as is shown in the accounts of thosewho have had sufficient opportunity of observation end_token the czar himself ispowerless against the bureaucratic body; he can send any one of them tosiberia, but he cannot govern without them, or against their will end_token onevery decree of his they have a tacit veto, by merely refraining fromcarrying it into effect end_token in countries of more advanced civilisation andof a more insurrectionary spirit, the public, accustomed to expecteverything to be done for them by the state, or at least to do nothingfor themselves without asking from the state not only leave to do it,but even how it is to be done, naturally hold the state responsible forall evil which befalls them, and when the evil exceeds their amount ofpatience, they rise against the government and make what is called arevolution; whereupon somebody else, with or without legitimateauthority from the nation, vaults into the seat, issues his orders tothe bureaucracy, and everything goes on much as it did before; thebureaucracy being unchanged, and nobody else being capable of takingtheir place end_tokena very different spectacle is exhibited among a people accustomed totransact their own business end_token in france, a large part of the peoplehaving been engaged in military service, many of whom have held at leastthe rank of non-commissioned officers, there are in every popularinsurrection several persons competent to take the lead, and improvisesome tolerable plan of action end_token what the french are in military affairs,the americans are in every kind of civil business; let them be leftwithout a government, every body of americans is able to improvise one,and to carry on that or any other public business with a sufficientamount of intelligence, order, and decision end_token this is what every freepeople ought to be: and a people capable of this is certain to be free;it will never let itself be enslaved by any man or body of men becausethese are able to seize and pull the reins of the centraladministration end_token no bureaucracy can hope to make such a people as this door undergo anything that they do not like end_token but where everything is donethrough the bureaucracy, nothing to which the bureaucracy is reallyadverse can be done at all end_token the constitution of such countries is anorganisation of the experience and practical ability of the nation, intoa disciplined body for the purpose of governing the rest; and the moreperfect that organisation is in itself, the more successful in drawingto itself and educating for itself the persons of greatest capacity fromall ranks of the community, the more complete is the bondage of all, themembers of the bureaucracy included end_token for the governors are as much theslaves of their organisation and discipline, as the governed are of thegovernors end_token a chinese mandarin is as much the tool and creature of adespotism as the humblest cultivator end_token an individual jesuit is to theutmost degree of abasement the slave of his order, though the orderitself exists for the collective power and importance of its members end_tokenit is not, also, to be forgotten, that the absorption of all theprincipal ability of the country into the governing body is fatal,sooner or later, to the mental activity and progressiveness of the bodyitself end_token banded together as they are--working a system which, like allsystems, necessarily proceeds in a great measure by fixed rules--theofficial body are under the constant temptation of sinking into indolentroutine, or, if they now and then desert that mill-horse round, ofrushing into some half-examined crudity which has struck the fancy ofsome leading member of the corps: and the sole check to these closelyallied, though seemingly opposite, tendencies, the only stimulus whichcan keep the ability of the body itself up to a high standard, isliability to the watchful criticism of equal ability outside the body end_tokenit is indispensable, therefore, that the means should exist,independently of the government, of forming such ability, and furnishingit with the opportunities and experience necessary for a correctjudgment of great practical affairs end_token if we would possess permanently askilful and efficient body of functionaries--above all, a body able tooriginate and willing to adopt improvements; if we would not have ourbureaucracy degenerate into a pedantocracy, this body must not engrossall the occupations which form and cultivate the faculties required forthe government of mankind end_tokento determine the point at which evils, so formidable to human freedomand advancement, begin, or rather at which they begin to predominateover the benefits attending the collective application of the force ofsociety, under its recognised chiefs, for the removal of the obstacleswhich stand in the way of its well-being; to secure as much of theadvantages of centralised power and intelligence, as can be had withoutturning into governmental channels too great a proportion of the generalactivity, is one of the most difficult and complicated questions in theart of government end_token it is, in a great measure, a question of detail, inwhich many and various considerations must be kept in view, and noabsolute rule can be laid down end_token but i believe that the practicalprinciple in which safety resides, the ideal to be kept in view, thestandard by which to test all arrangements intended for overcoming thedifficulty, may be conveyed in these words: the greatest disseminationof power consistent with efficiency; but the greatest possiblecentralisation of information, and diffusion of it from the centre end_tokenthus, in municipal administration, there would be, as in the new englandstates, a very minute division among separate officers, chosen by thelocalities, of all business which is not better left to the personsdirectly interested; but besides this, there would be, in eachdepartment of local affairs, a central superintendence, forming a branchof the general government end_token the organ of this superintendence wouldconcentrate, as in a focus, the variety of information and experiencederived from the conduct of that branch of public business in all thelocalities, from everything analogous which is done in foreigncountries, and from the general principles of political science end_token thiscentral organ should have a right to know all that is done, and itsspecial duty should be that of making the knowledge acquired in oneplace available for others end_token emancipated from the petty prejudices andnarrow views of a locality by its elevated position and comprehensivesphere of observation, its advice would naturally carry much authority;but its actual power, as a permanent institution, should, i conceive, belimited to compelling the local officers to obey the laws laid down fortheir guidance end_token in all things not provided for by general rules, thoseofficers should be left to their own judgment, under responsibility totheir constituents end_token for the violation of rules, they should beresponsible to law, and the rules themselves should be laid down by thelegislature; the central administrative authority only watching overtheir execution, and if they were not properly carried into effect,appealing, according to the nature of the case, to the tribunal toenforce the law, or to the constituencies to dismiss the functionarieswho had not executed it according to its spirit end_token such, in its generalconception, is the central superintendence which the poor law board isintended to exercise over the administrators of the poor rate throughoutthe country end_token whatever powers the board exercises beyond this limit, wereright and necessary in that peculiar case, for the cure of rooted habitsof maladministration in matters deeply affecting not the localitiesmerely, but the whole community; since no locality has a moral right tomake itself by mismanagement a nest of pauperism, necessarilyoverflowing into other localities, and impairing the moral and physicalcondition of the whole labouring community end_token the powers of administrativecoercion and subordinate legislation possessed by the poor law board(but which, owing to the state of opinion on the subject, are veryscantily exercised by them), though perfectly justifiable in a case offirst-rate national interest, would be wholly out of place in thesuperintendence of interests purely local end_token but a central organ ofinformation and instruction for all the localities, would be equallyvaluable in all departments of administration end_token a government cannot havetoo much of the kind of activity which does not impede, but aids andstimulates, individual exertion and development end_token the mischief beginswhen, instead of calling forth the activity and powers of individualsand bodies, it substitutes its own activity for theirs; when, instead ofinforming, advising, and, upon occasion, denouncing, it makes them workin fetters, or bids them stand aside and does their work instead ofthem end_token the worth of a state, in the long run, is the worth of theindividuals composing it; and a state which postpones the interests oftheir mental expansion and elevation, to a little more ofadministrative skill, or of that semblance of it which practice gives,in the details of business; a state which dwarfs its men, in order thatthey may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficialpurposes, will find that with small men no great thing can really beaccomplished; and that the perfection of machinery to which it hassacrificed everything, will in the end avail it nothing, for want of thevital power which, in order that the machine might work more smoothly,it has preferred to banish end_token\n"
